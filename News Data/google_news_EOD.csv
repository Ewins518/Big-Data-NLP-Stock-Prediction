2,2023-06-20T21:24:10+00:00,UPDATE 2-EU singles out 19 tech giants for online content rules,"(Adds details on Meta, Twitter, TikTok)

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, April 25 (Reuters) - Five Alphabet subsidiaries, two Meta Platforms units, two Microsoft businesses, Twitter and Alibaba's AliExpress are among 19 companies subject to landmark EU online content rules, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on Tuesday.

The rules known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) require the companies to do risk management, conduct external and independent auditing, share data with authorities and researchers and adopt a code of conduct by August.

The 19 companies include Alphabet's Google Maps, Google Play, Google Search, Google Shopping and YouTube, Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Amazon's Marketplace and Apple's App Store.

The others are Microsoft's two units Linkedin and Bing, booking.com, Pinterest, Snap Inc's Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Wikipedia, Zalando and Alibaba's AliExpress.

""We consider these 19 online platforms and search engines have become systematically relevant and have special responsibilities to make the internet safer,"" Breton told reporters.

The companies will have to do more to tackle disinformation, give more protection and choice to users and ensure stronger protection for children or risk fines as much as 6% of their global turnover.

Breton said he was checking to see whether another four to five companies fall under the DSA, with a decision expected in the next few weeks.

Breton singled out Facebook's content moderation system for criticism because of its role in building opinions on key issues.

""Now that Facebook has been designated as a very large online platform, Meta needs to carefully investigate the system and fix it where needed ASAP,"" he said.

Twitter and TikTok also showed up high on Breton's radar.

""At the invitation of Elon Musk, my team and I will carry out a stress test live at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco,"" he said.

""We are also committed to a stress test with TikTok which has expressed also interest. So I look forward to an invitation to Bytedance's headquarters to understand better the origin of Tiktok,"" Breton said. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee Editing by Christina Fincher)"

Grocery and meal delivery services are a convenient way to reduce trips to the supermarket -- and spending on those unnecessary items that sneak their way into your cart as you shop.

Learn: How To Build a Financial Plan From Zero The landscape of grocery delivery companies has changed quite a bit over the last few years, with once-popular services such as Chef'd and Terra's Kitchen shutting their doors and traditional retailers such as Walmart entering the space.

But some of these services come at a premium, which can potentially put a strain on your budget. Keep reading to see what the current batch of online grocery delivery companies offer in terms of products, prices and convenience, so you can avoid making a costly mistake. Arturo Torres / Instacart

1. Instacart

For people who need their groceries immediately, Instacart is an excellent option. Serving all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Instacart can deliver items in as little as one hour.

Unlike other online grocery delivery services, Instacart doesn't ship your food from giant warehouses. Instead, it connects you with freelance personal shoppers who bring you groceries from your favorite supermarkets -- including Whole Foods, Costco and Petco.

You can sign up for Instacart Express to save even more money if you use the service regularly. An Instacart Express subscription-based membership costs $99 per year, which breaks down to $8.25 per month, or it's $9.99 per month if you pay monthly. The membership entitles you to free delivery on orders of $35 or more, even if you order from more than one store. You also get a discount on the 5% services fee, and there's no extra charge for deliveries made during peak service hours.

How much does Instacart cost? The delivery fee ranges from $3.99 to $7.99, depending on the size of your order and how quickly you want your delivery. The minimum order is $10.

Is Instacart Worth It?

Instacart is an excellent value considering you can get groceries from multiple stores delivered the same day you order them.

Who is Instacart best for? Here's who should consider Instacart and who should take a pass:

2. Amazon Fresh

There's a $9.95 delivery fee for orders under $50 and a $6.95 delivery fee for orders between $50 and $100. Orders between $100 and $150 are a $3.95 delivery fee. To bypass the online grocery delivery fee, Prime members must spend more than $150, which is an increase from the previous threshold of $35.

Amazon offers Fresh in select markets. Though membership for this service is pricey, the items themselves tend to be priced competitively, with great supermarket deals.

How much does Amazon Fresh cost? Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. Without an Amazon Prime membership, there's a $9.95 delivery fee for orders under $50, a $6.95 delivery fee for orders between $50 and $100, and a $3.95 delivery fee for orders between $100 and $150.

Is Amazon Fresh Worth It?

Some people might be deterred by the extra charge, but this price is actually not bad, considering the selection and convenience.

Who is Amazon Fresh best for? Amazon Fresh isn't the right choice for everyone.

Amazon Prime subscribers not satisfied with Pantry product selection might find Amazon Fresh more to their liking. Limited delivery area means you'll need to live in a participating market to take advantage of this service.

Who is Peapod best for? Peapod is a good fit for some, but not all, shoppers.

4. Vons

The early bird really does get the worm with Vons' grocery delivery service. Vons, which operates under theÂ Albertsons company banner, offers same-day grocery delivery, based on availability. You'll see your delivery time options when reserving a time or checking out, according to Vons' website.

Two-hour delivery is available in select areas between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. This service is provided by Instacart, and additional fees apply.

One of the biggest benefits of the Vons service is its ""just for U"" feature. This loyalty program provides digital coupons, personalized special deals and points rewards you can redeem for gas and grocery discounts and freebies.

Vons doesn't restrict customers to having their orders delivered. The grocer's ""Drive Up & Go!"" service lets you order your groceries online and pick them up at your local participating Vons store, where they'll be loaded into your car for you.

The minimum order amount is $30, and new customers get free delivery on their first online order of at least $30.

Is Vons Delivery Worth It?

Vons delivery is worth it for people who are extremely busy. It isn't among the cheapest grocery delivery services, but because users can earn points for gas and grocery discounts and freebies, the cost might be worth it for customers who place frequent large orders.

Who is Vons best for? Consider this before signing up:

Vons is best for Albertsons customers who want traditional supermarket perks like loyalty rewards and curbside pickup. Vons is a less-than-stellar choice for budget-conscious shoppers who don't typically place huge orders. EQRoy / Shutterstock.com

5. FreshDirect

FreshDirect customers can find high-quality fresh foods and prepared mealsÂ along with their favorite brand-name items and alcohol and purchase them with the click of a button. New users of FreshDirect's convenient online grocery delivery service receive two months of deliveries for just one penny with the DeliveryPass.

FreshDirect currently offers its services in Washington, D.C., and parts of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Delaware, with delivery on the Jersey Shore and in the Hamptons available in the summer only.

Who is FreshDirect best for? Certain individuals are likely to be thrilled with FreshDirect. But it's not for everyone.

FreshDirect is best for those who live in the New York City and Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas -- you also won't have to miss out on your deliveries while summer vacationing in the Hamptons or Jersey Shore. FreshDirect is best avoided by shoppers who don't want to overspend on grocery delivery but also don't want to restrict their orders to three days per week.

6. Google Shopping

Google Shopping is the current iteration of the search giant's discontinued Google Express grocery delivery service. The service differs from other shopping sites in that it essentially aggregates product listings from merchants that market their products on the site. You search for products by selecting the Grocery category from the navigation links on theÂ Google Shopping homepage and applying filters to narrow your search results. The site offers three options for purchasing the items you select:

Order directly from the merchant's website for home delivery. Order directly from the merchant, via Google Shopping's checkout, for home delivery. Visit a local brick-and-mortar retailer to purchase in person.

Customers who checkout via Google Shopping will see their options for delivery time frames. Delivery times vary by merchant and the customer's location.

How much does Google Shopping cost? Delivery is free as long as you meet the store's minimum order amount -- generally $25 to $35 before taxes and fees. A shipping fee or a flat $4.99 small-order delivery fee is applied to orders that don't meet the merchant's minimum. Halfpoint / Shutterstock.com

Is Google Shopping Worth It?

One of the perks of Google Shopping is that you can compare prices from both online and brick-and-mortar retailers and choose how you want to purchase. With no subscription fees and free or low-cost delivery, Google Shopping's value is hard to beat.

Who is Google Shopping best for? Ubiquitous as Google might be, the company's shopping service won't meet everyone's needs.

Google Shopping is best for bargain hunters who place a higher priority on savings than convenience. Google Shopping might not be the best choice for anyone who wants to make quick work of selecting and ordering their groceries. Yvan DubA / iStock.com

The minimum order for same-day delivery is $35.

8. Thrive Market

Thrive Market is a socially conscious service that delivers over 6,000 organic and non-genetically modified products spanning food, home and beauty categories. Members get members-only pricing as well as perks like freebies and special deals. Shipping is available to street addresses in the contiguous U.S., and your first order over $25 ships free.

Part of your membership fee sponsors memberships and credits for low-income families as well as students, teachers, veterans and first responders, according to the company's website.

How much does Thrive Market cost? Annual memberships cost $59.95. The company guarantees you'll make that back in savings or it'll credit the difference when you renew your membership. Shipping is free for orders of $49 or more. The delivery fee for orders that don't meet the minimum is $5.95. vgajic / Getty Images

Is Thrive Market Worth It?

Thrive Market guarantees you'll save on your grocery purchases, so there's really nothing to lose as long as you sign up for another year to collect your credit. Plus, you can feel good about your membership helping needy families, students and civil servants.

Who is Thrive Market best for? Thrive Market serves a niche segment of grocery shoppers.

Thrive Market is best for socially conscious shoppers who don't want to spend more than they have to for organic and non-GMO groceries. Thrive Market is probably not the right choice for shoppers who prefer to stick with familiar name-brand groceries.

9. Walmart Grocery

Walmart Grocery delivers grocery orders to metropolitan areas throughout most of the contiguous U.S.Â You can specify delivery windows and have orders delivered to your home or another location. Or, if you prefer to pick up your orders, choose your store and reserve a time slot, and the order will be brought to your car when you arrive.

You'll find a much wider selection of product categories on Walmart Grocery than on other grocery sites. You can purchase clothing and electronics, for example, in the same order as food.

How much does Walmart Grocery cost? There's no charge for pickup service, and you can get unlimited free deliveries for $98 per year or $12.95 per month. As of this writing, a 30-day free trial is available, but you'll need to select your preferred payment plan to qualify. Nomofoto / Shutterstock.com

Is Walmart Grocery Worth It?

Based just on the convenience of being able to purchase a range of products while you grocery shop and get the whole order delivered free, $98 per year is worth paying.

Who is Walmart Grocery best for? Even people who avoid shopping at Walmart might take a second look at Walmart Grocery.

Walmart Grocery is best for people who want home delivery and like the idea of combining grocery shopping with shopping for other household items -- just like they do in Walmart stores. People who don't mind picking up groceries as long as they don't have to shop for them are best off saving the subscription fee and sticking with pickup service. Miriam Doerr Martin Frommherz / Shutterstock.com

Are Grocery Delivery Services Worth It?

To determine if a grocery delivery service is worth the cost, examine your life and schedule. Grocery delivery could be a significant time-saver when you're constantly running from one task to the next.

New-customer discounts let you try these services at low cost and little or no commitment. Discounts can be especially useful if you're trying meal-kits for the first time and aren't sure how they'll fit into your routine. It's also a low-risk way to experiment with a variety of services to see which works best for you and your budget.

Big gains in the stock have been fueled by the companyâs pledge to become a more efficient operation involving thousands of job cuts. Yet, cost-saving measures are likely mostly done for now, while Wednesdayâs results are unlikely to show many signs of a sustainable rebound in digital advertising spending.

For the first quarter, revenue is expected to decline 0.9%, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That will likely be followed by only a slow recovery, with single-digit growth being anticipated through year-end, paling alongside the companyâs average growth of 42% over the decade since 2012.

Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said he isnât expecting a recovery in digital ads in 2023, while noting that most of Metaâs cost reductions âhave largely been accounted for.â Still, reduced expectations âlook attainable as long as advertising spend doesnât fall off a cliff,â he said.

Metaâs advertising sales, which make up nearly all its revenue, have come under pressure after Apple Inc. tweaked its privacy policy to make it hard for social media platforms to target iPhone users. To further exacerbate the situation, concerns about high inflation, growing competition and a potential recession have squeezed ad budgets at many businesses.

The first indication of the ad industryâs health will be on display when Google owner Alphabet Inc. reports first-quarter results after markets close Tuesday. Snap Inc. is slated to deliver earnings on Thursday.

Story continues

Even long-term Meta bulls like RBC Capital Marketsâ Brad Erickson are cautious going into the results. The brokerâs checks showed some unexpected deterioration in Metaâs return on ad spend after the firm made some changes to its platform in the second half of March, he said.

To be sure, even after this yearâs rally, the stock hardly looks expensive. Trading at 16 times projected earnings, the Instagram parent is not only cheaper than tech megacaps like Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc., itâs also at a lower multiple than the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes. And itâs a far-cry from its 10-year average of 26 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Bulls like Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, are optimistic that the digital ad market will rebound and help power more gains for the stock.

âThe revenue growth rate does have a chance to re-accelerate from here,â said Martin, who owns the stock in all his strategies. âWhere it goes from there is another question, but re-acceleration is a good sign.â

Tech Chart of the Day

With the biggest technology companies due to report earnings in coming days, options imply that the stocks will swing at least 4% in either direction after results â putting hundreds of billions of market capitalization at stake. Meta, which has seen its stock move an average of 7.9% after its past earnings updates, is expected to swing 10.2%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft and Alphabet are slated to kick off the big tech earnings season when they report after the market closes Tuesday.

Top Tech Stories

Apple Inc. notched another victory in its long-running court battle to block Epic Games Inc. from breaking down barriers in the App Store, but the iPhone makerâs moneymaking fortress remains under siege. Fox News, in announcing Monday that itâs parted ways with Tucker Carlson, is losing a host who brought in millions of viewers but proved too much to handle even for corporate chiefs Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. Cisco Systems Inc. warned that artificial intelligence software such as OpenAIâs ChatGPT will make phishing attempts much harder to detect, requiring companies to adopt new defenses. Two of the most highly compensated lawyers in the media industry â the legal chiefs for Netflix Inc. and Sirius XM Holdings Inc. â saw their pay rise last year as both companies battled to add subscribers. The euphoria surrounding Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.âs spinoff plan appears to be all but over. PDD Holdings Inc.âs Temu, one of the most downloaded apps in the US this year, is rolling out across major European markets as it seeks to rival Shein in the fast-fashion e-commerce space.

Expanding upon Google for Startups Cloud, an existing initiative that provides startups free credits to use the tech behemothâs servers, among other perks, the new program will include specific benefits for emerging Web3 companies.

These include access to a set of grants from ââAptos, Celo, Flow, the HBAR Foundation, Near, and the Solana Foundation, all of which have separately offered up $1 millionâfor a total of $6 millionâto support Web3 startups building on Google Cloud. Nansen, a blockchain data analytics firm, has also pitched in, offering discounts to startups on its analytics products. And Alchemy, a Web3 developer platform, will provide members credits to the platformâs suite of services, mentorship, and priority access to its Web3 bootcamp.

âOur new benefits give Web3 projects and startups the technology, community, and resources that they need to focus on innovation over infrastructure,â James Tromans, Google Cloudâs Web3 engineering director, and Ryan Kiskis, director of Google Cloudâs Startup Ecosystem, wrote in a post announcing the new effort.

Other perks include early access to Google Cloudâs Web3 products as well as priority review for Coinbaseâs Base Ecosystem Fund, which supports projects planning to build on Base, the companyâs recently announced layer-2 blockchain.

""From their perspective maybe it's a low risk one,"" Andrew Thurman, a spokesperson for Nansen, told Fortune in reference to Google Cloud's Web3 startup program. ""They're offering free Google Cloud Credits and really just organizing as a nexus for many of these services and protocols. But it's sort of undeniable that this is one of the bolder steps they've taken into the blockchain space.""

Story continues

The program builds on more than a year of momentum from Googleâs cloud computing arm as it looks to edge out Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the other two titans of cloud computing, in attracting a growing field of Web3 developers to Googleâs servers.

While Google Cloud took its first public step into Web3 in 2018 when it added datasets for Bitcoin and eventually other blockchains into BigQuery, a method for developers to ping large databases, it accelerated its Web3 strategy when it announced the creation of its own dedicated digital assets and Web3 engineering teams in 2022.

Since then, the cloud computing giant has announced a near-constant stream of partnerships with prominent crypto firms and blockchains, including Coinbase, BNB Chain, Celo, and Casper Labs.

It has also offered up its servers as validators, or computers that help secure and maintain blockchains, for the Sky Mavis, Solana, and Tezos blockchains.

And in October, it unveiled the Blockchain Node Engine, a streamlined method for developers to access and use blockchains on Googleâs servers.

âGoogleâs partnership is crucial in realizing Web3âs potential,â Mo Shaikh, cofounder and CEO of Aptos Labs, said in a statement to Fortune.

Google Cloud is looking to help Web3 builders fast-track their projects by expanding its early-stage support program for the community.

The âGoogle for Startups Cloud Programâ initiative, which provides support for startups and emerging projects, will now be offered to builders in the Web3 industry to scale their projects faster and more securely, according to a press release on Tuesday. Eligible projects from pre-seed to Series A, will be able to apply for the program, which includes up to $200,000 in Google Cloud credits, over two years, as well as other technical support, the press release said.

Google, a Web2 powerhouse, has been pushing further into the Web3 world in recent years by helping developers use its technical expertise to build projects. Earlier this month, the Celo Foundation said that it was working with Google Cloud to offer workshops and cloud computing services to developers and Web3 founders building on Celo.

Last year, BNB Chain, a blockchain closely linked to the crypto exchange Binance, said it was joining with Google Cloud to support the growth of early-stage Web3 and blockchain startups.

âGoogle Cloud has been working closely with Web3 companies for several years,â James Tromans, head of Web3 engineering at Google Cloud, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. âWe are committed to supporting the growth of the Web3 ecosystem, and the expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program to the Web3 community reinforces our goal of equipping blockchain developers with the tools they need to succeed.â

Other program benefits will include early access to Google Cloudâs Web3 products and training on latest cloud-based technologies, according to the press release.

The program will give projects access to capital from various partners, including a total of up to $3 million in investments from the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund. Eligible projects could also receive a $1 million grant from each of Google Cloudâs foundation partners: Aptos, Celo, Flow, HBAR Foundation and the Near and Solana foundations, the press release said.

âThe expansion of the Google for Startups Cloud Program for Web3 means giving startups the ability to build on our fully managed, serverless platform, as well as the resources and community to be successful without creating technical debt that slows them down,â Tromans said in the statement.

The move comes as Google Cloudâs topmost competitor, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is ramping up its own efforts to increase its market share into the Web3 industry. In January, layer 1 blockchain Ava Labs said it partnered with AWS to accelerate Web3 adoption, and a month after, AWS posted that it's looking to hire Web3 staff for its cloud services."

11,2023-06-20T13:45:05+00:00,S&amp;P 500 slumps as underwhelming quarterly results rattle sentiment,"Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Tuesday, weighed down by a string of underwhelming earnings from corporate America just ahead of the highly anticipated results from big tech.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1%, or 320 points lower, and the Nasdaq fell 1.7%.

Investor jitters in the banking sector returned after First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) plunged 40% to record lows after reporting mixed first-quarter results that also showed its deposit levels fell by $104 billion from a year earlier, much more than the expected $40B decline.

The decline in deposits forced the bank to âsignificantly increase its borrowings,â Wedbush says, pressuring core net interest margins, which is likely to continue to come âunder substantial pressure in 2Q, negatively impacting the bank's earnings power significantly.â

The report soured sentiment on regional banks as the S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) dropped more than 3%.

United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), meanwhile, reported first-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines, and the courier company warned that sales were expected to remain under pressure, sending its share price more than 9% lower.

â[A]lthough the macro environment remains a challenge across all transports, we continue to rate UPS shares a Buy due to valuation and secular outlook,â Goldman Sachs said in a note.

PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) was up more than 2%, sidestepping the selling after its quarterly results topped estimates on both the top and bottom lines as price hikes bolstered performance.

3M Company (NYSE:MMM) gave up gains to trade lower despite reporting earnings that topped Wall Street estimates and announcing plans to cut about 6,000 jobs.

McDonaldâs (NYSE:MCD) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) were also in the red despite reporting quarterly results that topped estimates.

A slump in chip stocks, meanwhile, pushed tech lower just as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ready their quarterly results, due after markets close on Tuesday, with some on Wall Street touting optimism.

Story continues

âI am quite optimistic that the very large index contributors will deliver earnings of high quality, and they're protecting their cash flows this year,â Neuberger Bermanâs Charles Kantor said in a Bloomberg interview on Tuesday.

Energy stocks were the biggest drag on the broader market, pressured by falling oil prices amid concerns about the impact of potential slowing global growth on demand.

In other news, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) fell more than 4% even as the Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for its ALS drug, with regulatory approval conditional on a further study to verify the clinical benefits of the drug.

Video Transcript

- Well, since we were talking tech here, let's stay on that thread. You can thank Microsoft and Alphabet for fueling the fervor around AI in the last few months. The tech giants both reporting after the bell today, AI, artificial intelligence is sure to dominate the conversation. What should investors look to hear? Yahoo Finance's, Dan Howley, joins us now. Dan, what are you going to be looking to hear?

DAN HOWLEY: I think the big to-do is going to be about AI. This is something that-- and that note, by the way, at first I thought it was going in the wrong direction where it was going to be like, yeah, everything is great. AI is going to power everyone forward. It's like, oh, well, let's all back up for a little bit. AI's been doing this for a while. This is a subset of AI that we're talking about, GPT. It's not-- we use AI all the time and everything. You get on your phone, you get a recommendation, that's AI, but I digress.

I think the big thing that people should be looking at not, necessarily talking about right now is going to be the cloud, and how the cloud continues to do. That's the profit driver, or the driver for the stock for the past few years, especially when it comes to Microsoft, Google trying to build out Google Cloud platform. They're still far behind Microsoft, still far behind Amazon.

And I think that's going to be the big discussion. They moved around some of the accounting when it comes to Google Cloud. So they're trying to make that more profitable in the interim at least on paper going forward. But I think what we've seen and what we're expecting out of Microsoft for the coming quarter is a continued decline in growth, a continued, slowing of growth in the cloud.

And there's a number of reasons for that, chief among them, companies cutting back on spending. And cloud is an important part of what companies have to do moving forward. It's not a market that's completely saturated yet. There's still tons of growth there.

Story continues

But if they can hold off at this point in time, then that's really what they're doing. I think another thing that it's on the fringes that people might still care about, but is a multibillion dollar business for Microsoft, is there more computing segment. And that's the PC sales. And they sell Windows licenses for the two third parties that sell computers. We're expecting a pretty big, substantial drop there just because people aren't buying computers at this point.

I think Gartner earlier this month, it said that worldwide PC shipments dropped 30% in the first quarter. So that's going to ding Microsoft pretty hard there. I think on the Google side of things, it's going to be how is that ad market picked back up. Is it picking back up? That's YouTube ads.

And any kind of commentary they're going to have on the GPT-ification we'll just say, of search, right? They have Bard. Bard is still something that you need an invite to try out. I've been playing with it not because I'm too cool. But I think it's something that we're going to have to talk about what that means for search going forward, because Microsoft's already doing that. It's pretty good. You know, I use Bing now exclusively over--

- Really?

DAN HOWLEY: Not Bing, Edge, excuse me. Still using Google because they got the Edge there. But I do use the Edge browser over Chrome. And I mean, it really does make a big difference.

- I'm going to call an audible here and ask you about your recent trip. You are just back from Japan. And I want to ask you that because especially as a tech reporter, to sort of get outside of the US bubble and go to a different place, is there anything you saw there from a technology standpoint what people there are using that surprised you or you found interesting?

DAN HOWLEY: So if you ride the subway, or you use mass transit in the US, I feel like everybody's ear if they're smart enough to not listen to what's going on around them, especially in New York subway, they have AirPods in. But there's not a lot of AirPods floating around there. And that's still a market that could be a growth opportunity for Apple. Japan is one of their larger markets. It's nothing like the US, North America, or China. But it is still an important place for them.

The other thing is, you sit on a bus, a train, you go out with friends and family, 95% of the time, you're probably going to see them rocking one of these bad boys. Tons of androids still in use there. And I think that's something that's great for Google. They're still look, Apple is the majority in the US, not the world. The majority and the rest of the world is still Android and Google. And it will be based on pricing alone, right?

So I think that's something that was really noticeable was just how Apple is this huge, dominant force here, but you have to step out of your bubble as you said. And that's really the big difference. And I think just to kind of add on to that the idea of Apple in India, when I was away, all I was getting was updates from Tim Cook on Twitter about going to India, the store opening over there. They have a long way go as far as getting any kind of traction there. The iPhone is--

- From a customer standpoint.

DAN HOWLEY: From the customer standpoint.

- Let alone the manufacturer standpoint.

DAN HOWLEY: I mean, the iPhone is so, so expensive compared to what you can get from Chinese manufacturers, and they're all Android. So you know, I mean, you can open a store all you want, but if it's still outrageously priced compared to the competition, you're not going to do much.

- Well, that's your next trip then.

DAN HOWLEY: Oof. I'll go to India, baby. Let's go.

- Yeah.

DAN HOWLEY: I'll get some saag over there, yeah.

- Dan Howley, welcome back. And thanks for that perspective. Really, it's interesting."

19,2023-06-20T10:30:55+00:00,Meta Muddles AI Progress: Chip Project Mishaps and Metaverse Ambitions Inflate Costs,"Despite splurging on AI research, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ: META) has struggled to adopt expensive AI-friendly hardware and software systems for its primary business.

By the end of summer 2022, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg gathered his top lieutenants for a comprehensive dissection of the company's computing capacity, focused on its ability to do cutting-edge artificial intelligence work, ReutersÂ cites a company memo dated September 20.

""We have a significant gap in our tooling, workflows, and processes when it comes to developing for AI. We need to invest heavily here,"" said the memo by the new head of infrastructure Santosh Janardhan.

Meta failed to acknowledge the AI-related challenges, including capacity crunches, leadership changes, and a scrapped AI chip project.

The revamp doubled Meta's capital expenditures to ~$4 billion a quarter while it battled a severe financial squeeze, laying off employees since November at a record scale. It led to the dumping of previously planned data center builds in four locations.

Meanwhile,Â Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT's popularity triggered an arms race among tech giants to release generative AI products.

Generative AI consumes reams of computing power, amplifying the urgency of Meta's capacity scramble. Meta's late embrace of the graphics processing unit, or GPU, for AI work, posed one of the reasons behind its trauma.

Also, Meta's pivot towards metaverse further slowed down its ability to deploy AI to respond to hazards like the rise ofÂ TikTok and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)-led ad privacy changes.

After shelving a large-scale rollout of its custom inference chip, Meta placed orders for billions of dollars worth ofÂ Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs in 2022, followed by the departure of several executives left Meta trailing behind peers like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google.

Story continues

Meta started retooling its data centers to acclimate the incoming GPUs. After that, it planned to develop a new and moreÂ ambitious in-house chip, which, like a GPU, can train AI models and perform inference, likely to finish around 2025.

Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth likewise said this month that generative AI was where he and Zuckerberg spent the most time, forecasting Meta would release a product this year.

Price Action: META shares traded lower by 1.66% at $209.16 on the last check Tuesday.

20,2023-06-20T09:43:48+00:00,Microsoft Q3 earnings: Despite cloud struggles tech giant beat on revenue and EPS,"Microsoft (MSFT) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, beating Wall Street's expectations, despite a continued slowdown in the company's cloud revenue.

The tech giant reported Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 27% year-over-year for the quarter. That number has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022, as companies trim their capital expenses amid rising interest rates.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $52.9 billion vs. $51.1 billion expected Adj. EPS: $2.45 vs. $2.23 expected Productivity and Business processes: $17.5 billion vs. $17.1 billion expected Intelligent Cloud: $22.1 billion vs. $21.9 billion expected More Personal Computing: $13.3 billion vs. $12.3 billion expected

Shares of Microsoft were up more than 4% following the announcement.

âThe world's most advanced AI models are coming together with the world's most universal user interface - natural language - to create a new era of computing,â Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.

âAcross the Microsoft Cloud, we are the platform of choice to help customers get the most value out of their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI.â

Microsoft helped kick off Big Tech's AI obsession with its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

The Windows maker has since implemented versions of OpenAI's technology in its Edge browser, Bing search engine, Microsoft 365 productivity software, and cybersecurity offerings. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella listens to a question at the annual Microsoft shareholders meeting Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016, in Bellevue, Wash. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)

That's given Microsoft a perceived leadership position in the AI wars, leaving rival Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) playing catch up. Amazon (AMZN), meanwhile, is working to bring generative AI to its services, while Facebook parent Meta (META) is cobbling together teams to kick start its own efforts.

And while Microsoftâs stock has seemingly benefited from both the AI hype and overall market rebound after a rough 2022, the company's main growth driver continues to be its cloud computing efforts in its Azure unit.

Story continues

But that growth has slowed markedly over the last year. In Q3 2022, Microsoft reported Azure growth of 46% year-over-year. But that's since fallen each quarter, landing at 27% in Q3 2023.

Part of the reason for this decline was large customers pulling back on spending as higher interest rates challenged global growth. Microsoft is also contending with flagging PC sales, as demand from consumers and business customers falls from pandemic-era highs.

The company reported a 9% decline in its More Personal Computing segment revenue, with Windows OEM revenue down 28%. Microsoft sells Windows and other software licenses to third-party PC partners.

21,2023-06-20T07:47:59+00:00,"Google-parent Alphabet's revenue beats on ad, cloud strength","By Akash Sriram and Greg Bensinger

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc said on Tuesday it would buy back $70 billion in stock and posted first-quarter profit and revenue above estimates as demand rose for cloud services and ad sales held up better than expected.

Investors cheered the buyback plan, sending shares of the Google parent about 4% higher in extended trading.

Excluding items, Alphabet reported earnings per share of $1.17, beating an average estimate of $1.07 per share.

""Google exceeded both revenue and earnings per share expectations this quarter, but reasons for investor optimism are modest,"" said Insider Intelligence senior analyst Max Willens.

He said turning a profit in cloud computing was ""notable"" but ""the reality is that Google Cloud remains comfortably behind its two most important competitors, and its growth is slowing."" Sales for the unit rose to 28% to $7.41 billion.

Advertisers, who contribute the bulk of Alphabet's sales, have curtailed their spending in response to a shift by consumers back to in-store shopping in the wake of eased masking and other restrictions. As well, advertisers are experimenting more with new platforms like TikTok, which attracts a more youthful audience.

Alphabet for the quarter reported a slight dip in ad sales to $54.55 billion from $54.66 billion a year earlier. The decline is just the third in the companyâs history since it became public in 2004 but follows a fourth-quarter drop of 3.6%. The company, meanwhile, has been looking to keep a tight control on costs amid recession fears and in January decided to cut about 12,000 jobs.

Alphabet has pared spending, including on employee perks and use of company resources. Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, told workers in an internal email in March that they should anticipate additional cost-cutting measures in the coming months.

Alphabetâs Google unit has been scrambling to keep pace with rivals, notably Microsoft Corp, in rolling out new artificial-intelligence software that can generate long-form responses to queries and other prompts. Microsoft committed $10 billion to OpenAI whose ChatGPT software has been the talk of Silicon Valley since a free version was introduced in November.

Microsoft on Tuesday also beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue, driven by growth in its cloud computing and Office productivity software businesses, pushing its shares up 4% in after-market trading. Shares of rival tech companies Meta Platforms Inc and Amazon.com Inc were also up 2%.

Alphabet's revenue for the quarter ended March 31 stood at $69.79 billion compared with estimates of $68.95 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

It reported net profit of $15.05 billion for the first three months of the year compared with $16.44 billion a year earlier.

Alphabet stock rose as much as 5% in after hours trading on the news.

The Google and YouTube parent company reported revenues that beat expectations in its advertising segments, even amid an industry-wide digital ad slowdown. YouTube's ad revenue came in at $6.69 billion, a small, but important, beat afterseveral tough quarters.

Alphabet's Google Cloud unit also turned a profit for the first time while revenue in this segment grew by 28%, the fastest of any of the company's main business segments.

Here are the key numbers from Alphabet's earnings, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Revenue: $69.7 billionactual versus $68.96 billion expected EPS: $1.17 actual versus $1.08 expected Google Ad Revenue: $54.55 billion actual versus $53.75 billion expected YouTube Ad Revenue: $6.69 billion actual versus $6.64 billion expected

""We are pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud,"" said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai in a statement.

""We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.""

The company also revealed a number of charges related to its efforts to rein in costs, including $2.6 billion in charges linked to the Alphabet's layoffs and office space cutbacks.

Like much of the tech industry, Alphabet has been cutting costs aggressively this year and announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs in January.

Google has also been at the center of the industry's AI competition that kicked off when ChatGPT's rise mad this technology the tech world's new growth catalyst. Over the last few months, Google's AI capabilities have been questioned by some as the company's AI chatbot, Bard, has failed to impress.

Story continues

Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) and its mega-investment in Open AI â which developed ChatGPT â has gained substantial public attention.

To reflect the company's shifting strategy, a number of changes are being made to its AI strategy, including the merging of two AI teams, Google Research's Brain unit and DeepMind.

This change was reflected in Tuesday's results, which saw AI costs broken out of Alphabet's Other Bets segment for the first time.

Losses related to the company's AI efforts totaled $3.3 billion during the first quarter while its Other Bets segment lost $1.23 billion. Operating income for Alphabet totaled $17.4 billion during the quarter.

An unprecedented downturn in Googleâs digital ad revenue â the companyâs main moneymaker for more than 20 years â came into sharper focus Tuesday with the release of the January-Marcy results for its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.

Although Alphabetâs total revenue for the period rose from the same last year, Googleâs first-quarter ad sales of $54.5 billion marked a slight decrease from a year ago. That dip followed a nearly 4% decline during the final three months of last year, making this the first time in Google has sustained back-to-back drops in year-over-year ad revenue since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004.

Googleâs YouTube video site, a marketing magnet in recent years, saw its ad sales decrease 2.5% from last year, marking its second consecutive quarter of erosion, too.

Boosted by growth in its cloud-computing division, Alphabetâs total revenue for the quarter came in at $69.8 billion, a 3% increase from last year. But the ad woes weighed on Alphabetâs earnings. The Mountain View, California, company earned $15.05 billion, or $1.17 per share, an 8% decrease from last year. More than $2 billion charges for mass layoffs and other cost cutting contributed to the earnings downturn.

Both Alphabet's revenue and profit exceeded the tempered expectations among analysts polled by FactSet Research. That â and a $70 billion stock buyback plan â helped lift Alphabet's stock price by 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The company's shares have fallen by about 15% during the past year amid investor concerns about Google's ad slump and worries about the company's future prospects.

âGoogleâs core business is facing the most serious challenges it has encountered in quite some time,â Insider Intelligence analyst Max Willens said after assessing the first-quarter results.

Story continues

To help prop up its profits, Alphabet in January announced plans to lay off 12,000 employees, or 6% workforce, by far the biggest payroll purge in its history. But the layoffs weren't completed before the end of the quarter, leaving Alphabet with more than 190,000 employees as of March 31, roughly the same number it had Dec. 31 after the company added nearly 34,000 workers last year. Alphabet expects its workforce to reflect the recent layoffs' by the end of June.

Googleâs current ad slump largely reflects more cautionary spending among companies reacting to a slowdown in discretionary consumer spending amid budget-pinching rise in inflation thatâs also fueling an increase in interest rates that could culminate in a recession.

But the artificially intelligent ChatGPT bot released that is being melded into Microsoftâs Bing search engine is raising fears Google could be facing a longer-term threat to Googleâs search engine that drags down ad revenue, too.

If people embrace ChatGPT and Bing as better ways to find what they are looking for, it could siphon away traffic from the Google search engine that has long been the internetâs main gateway. That in turn would depress Googleâs ad sales.

Google is trying to counter the popularity of ChatGPT with its own alternative, dubbed Bard, but so far has restrained its capabilities t o ensure it doesnât behave in a way that offends its billions of users â and advertisers in the process â and to reduce the chances it manufactures misinformation and other fabrications that the technology calls âhallucinations.â"

Google managed to beat a downturn in the wider tech sector thanks to an increase in demand for its cloud services, as rival Microsoft enjoyed a 7pc boost to revenues.

Alphabet, the search giant's parent company, reported revenues grew to $69.8bn (Â£56.2bn) in the first three months of 2023, beating analyst expectations, but only improving by 3pc compared to the previous year.

Meanwhile, Microsoft, which is locked in a race with Google to develop a new wave of AI chatbots, revealed a 7pc increase in revenues to $53bn and a boost in profitability.

Profits fell at Alphabet as the tech giant took a $2bn hit on restructuring costs after it laid off a total of 12,000 staff in January, 6pc of its workforce.

The companyâs internet services business, its cloud division, recorded a profit for the first time.

Despite besting gloomy market expectations, the quarterly growth figures remained one of Alphabetâs slowest on record amid a slowdown in digital advertising spending. The tech giant also announced a share buyback, worth $70bn, despite mass layoffs across the technology sector.

Its growth rate remained significantly down on the previous year and profits fell. Shares ticked up 3pc in after market trading.

The tech giant has bet its hopes on a new race for artificial intelligence, embedding digital chatbots into its search products.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, said: âOur long-term investments in deep computer science make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point, and Iâm excited by the AI-driven leaps weâre about to unveil in Search and beyond.

Microsoft, which has signed a multibillion dollar deal with OpenAI to use its technology for internet search, hailed its AI efforts in its earnings.

Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief executive, said: âThe worldâs most advanced AI models are coming together with the worldâs most universal user interface â natural language â to create a new era of computing.â

Microsoft has had its own share of layoffs as tech giants attempt to adjust to a post-pandemic slowdown in the tech economy. Microsoft shares jumped 5pc in after hours trading."

April 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major averages suffered their deepest declines so far this month as a downbeat UPS forecast exacerbated investor concerns about a slowing U.S. economy on Tuesday while plunging deposits at regional First Republic Bank added to jitters about the bank sector's health.

Shares in United Parcel Service Inc fell 10%, its biggest daily loss since July 2006, after the courier company forecast full-year revenue at the lower end of its prior target.

This helped push the Dow Jones Transport Average index down 3.6%, for its biggest one-day drop since September.

Also worrying was Tuesday's data showing U.S. consumer confidence fell to a nine-month low in April.

""Investors have been trying valiantly to hold it together in the midst of a big earnings and economic data week and a big Federal Reserve week next week,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer for BMO Family Office based in Chicago.

Traders largely expect the central bank to hike rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday after its Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

Microsoft Corp shares rebounded after closing down 2.2% in the regular session and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 ahead of its quarterly report. It reversed course to rise 4.6% in late trading after its revenue beat analysts' expectations.

Similarly, shares in Google's parent Alphabet Inc rose 4% after the bell when its first-quarter revenue surpassed expectations on an advertising uptick and steady cloud services demand. It had closed down 2%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 344.57 points, or 1.02%, to 33,530.83; and the S&P 500 lost 65.41 points, or 1.58%, at 4,071.63, with both marking their biggest one-day percentage losses since March 22.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 238.05 points, or 1.98%, to 11,799.16 in its biggest one-day percentage decline since March 9.

The KBW Regional Banking index dropped 3.9% as First Republic shares fell 49%, hitting a record low.

The beleaguered lender reported a more than $100 billion flight in deposits in the first quarter following the biggest banking crisis since 2008 last month.

""People are trying to figure out the health of the regional banks in general. Is there a canary in the coal mine? It's really important for mid-size businesses in the country that the regional banks stay healthy,"" said BMO's Schleif.

Also on investors minds was an apparent lawmaker stand-off in Washington over raising the U.S. debt ceiling.

""Anytime you hear about a potential default that would trigger a risk-off environment. If we go to the brink and even beyond that wouldn't bode well for risk assets or consumer confidence,"" said Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network in Boston.

Shares in medical technology firm Danaher Corp fell 8.8% after it cut its annual sales growth forecast.

General Motors Co shares fell 4% after it cautioned that 2022 price gains will not last as the year goes on, even as it lifted full-year profit and cash flow forecasts.

PepsiCo Inc shares rose 2.2% after it raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 4.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.50-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 378 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 10.78 billion shares traded compared with the 10.32 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The artificial intelligence sector has long been a prized area in the technology industry which has transformed the global economy. The sector has wide-reaching applications in a diverse range of industries, such as interactive media and entertainment and even cybersecurity. The AI market is thus highly diverse and immensely large, valued at about $119.78 billion in 2022, as we mentioned in a previous article. This market size can perhaps be best attributed to the importance of AI and machine learning (ML) in the operations of various businesses.

The Rise of AI and ML

According to a report by Rackspace Technology published in February, a survey revealed that AI and ML were second only to cybersecurity when it came to the most important technologies for businesses today. The survey polled about 1420 IT professionals across the globe in several industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail, hospitality, government, and healthcare. Of all the respondents, 69% of them ranked AI and ML as a high priority in their organizations in 2023. The survey further showed that companies today are using AI and ML to improve processes, predict business performance and industry trends, and reduce business risks.

The report also showed a focus on sustainability when it comes to these technologies. About 60% of the organizations surveyed noted that AI and ML helped them meet sustainability targets by improving worker safety and security. Another 54% of respondents stated that these technologies aided them in monitoring energy consumption, while 47% of respondents noted that AI and ML enabled predictive analytics for these businesses as well.

Investing in AI and ML

With the wide application of AI and ML in a variety of industries and businesses, it is no surprise that investment in these technologies has also been on the rise in recent years. Mega tech companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are among the biggest investors in AI as they try to ensure they are not left behind in the wake of this rapidly transforming sector. However, the report published by Rackspace Technology also illustrated how these technologies are not exclusively invested in by wealthy global multinational companies anymore. Of the organizations surveyed, the annual investment in AI and ML for these companies is as follows: 22% of the businesses invested up to $100,000, 28% invested between $100,000 to $500,000, 27% of the respondents invested $500,000 to $1 million, and 20% invested about $1 million to $5 million in these technologies. The global average annual investment in AI and ML came up to over $1 million between these organizations alone.

Story continues

Because of this rising investment in AI and ML, IT leaders continue to see great potential in these technologies today. They believe that AI and ML will help improve innovation, reduce business costs, and enhance business performance. Most businesses today have been using these technologies to meet these goals while also attempting to increase their productivity and revenue streams through AI and ML as well. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the cheapest AI stocks to invest in today.

âAcross the Microsoft Cloud, we are the platform of choice to help customers get the most value out of their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI,"" CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.

The company continues to ride the generative AI craze wave. Microsoft made a multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI earlier this year, sparking an industry wide appetite for artificial intelligence. The Windows maker has since implemented versions of OpenAI's technology in its Edge browser, Bing search engine, Microsoft 365 productivity software, and cybersecurity offerings.

One analyst described the tech giant's performance last quarter as ""an inflection.""

âThis is the first quarter theyâre showing positive operating income [for cloud]. They reshuffled some costs here and there, thatâs a minor yellow flag, but I think on a reported basis, they are positive on margins for the first time on the cloud. So thatâs an inflection quarter,â Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at Roth MKM told Yahoo Finance Live

YouTube's revenue dipped amid an advertising slowdown. Alphabetâs ad sales are closely watched as a barometer for the overall health of the advertising market.

A continued rebound in global travel helped increase cross-border volume payments, which increased 24% year-over-year.

""Visa's strong fiscal second quarter performance reflects continued focus on our growth levers â consumer payments, new flows and value added services,"" CEO Ryan McInerney said in the company's fiscal second quarter earning release.

The results are a continuation of the previous quarter when the company said it saw ""stable payments volume"" along with continued cross-border travel recovery.

PacWest Bancorp

PacWest Bancorp (PACW) shares spiked more than 15% post market after the regional bank said deposits have been building in recent weeks.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Rohit, what would you like Google to focus on in regards to their longer-term investments, what we were just talking about? Because, of course, the common, I guess, you could say, maybe, thought on the street right now is that Google is in a vulnerable position given Microsoft's investment in OpenAI and the potential there for AI.

ROHIT KULKARNI: Yeah, absolutely, [INAUDIBLE]. It is in a vulnerable position. They are losing the PR war, if you will. They are not yet losing any fundamental kind of profits so far. So ""so far"" being the key word there.

Story continues

So I think from prioritizing long-term investments-- Silicon Valley has always believed that Google is the leader in AI. Google has always done the cutting-edge research and brought around new products on AI, but we are not seeing any real direct-to-consumer AI killer app from Google yet. So I think that's what we need to focus on, what is that AI killer app that Google can introduce in the next 3, 6, 12 months and how can they [? maybe ?] turn the PR table into a more of a fundamental battle as such.

DIANE KING HALL: Rohit, you mentioned wanting to see more cost-cutting measures from Alphabet, and, I mean, they announced some earlier this year with making dramatic job cuts, which you hadn't seen, really, in the company's history. So what is it that you want to see from them next with regard to cost-cutting measures?

ROHIT KULKARNI: Again, I think we need to acknowledge that we are still in a soft revenue growth zone for our entire industry. Google is showing search revenues growing 1% to 2%. So that's not heroic by any measures. So as we are in this soft revenue growth era, we think costs also need to grow in line, and I think hiring needs to slow down.

So if-- they had laid off so many people, yet the headcount increased sequentially, quarter over quarter. So I think we need a little bit of softer headcount growth, or, in fact, we would like to see headcount to be, actually, declining, quarter over quarter, just so that the base of operating expense that Google carries forward while the revenue growth is softer, I think that goes in line.

So I feel that there needs to be a little bit of extra discipline from a cost standpoint, and with the revenue upside that we are seeing, that would just simply put rocket ship boosters to the stock."
38,2023-06-16T14:49:00+00:00,Alphabet Shares Rise on Revenue Beat As Ad Sales Recover,"(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported first-quarter results that exceeded analystsâ estimates, as the companyâs dominant search business weathered the economic downturn and its cloud unit turned a profit for the first time.

Shares rose on news that Alphabetâs sales, excluding partner payouts, were $58.07 billion in the quarter, beating analystsâ average estimate of $56.98 billion. Search advertising performed well even as Google faces heightened competitive threats from Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI, which are challenging the search giant through conversational chatbots using artificial intelligence.

Search advertising has been more resilient during swings in the economy than spending on social media, where digital media competitors such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Snap Inc. have seen more dramatic declines in demand. Even video site YouTube, which has been a drag on the companyâs results in recent quarters, performed better than expected, drawing $6.69 billion in advertising revenue, though it still registered a drop from the year-ago quarter.

âSearch performance will serve as an early indicator of Googleâs ability to maintain its dominance in the area responsible for the majority of its revenue,â Evelyn Mitchell, a senior analyst with Insider Intelligence, wrote in a note.

The companyâs closely watched cloud unit, which is much smaller than competitive offerings from Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc., reported profit of $191 million. As its core search advertising business matures, Google sees cloud as growth area. Alphabet said in a note to investors ahead of the results that it had shifted the reporting of some costs from Google Cloud to Google Services, likely aiding the long-running campaign for profitability.

Story continues

Alphabet leadership has been waging a cost-cutting drive to preserve the companyâs profit margins as advertisers trim their budgets. In January, the company cut about 12,000 people.

âWe remain committed to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering our cost base,â Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. âWe have seen ongoing headwinds in what we continue to describe as an ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment.â

Net income was $15 billion, or $1.17 per share, compared with Wall Streetâs $1.09-per-share estimate. The company also authorized share buybacks of up to $70 billion.

Alphabet shares rose as much as 5.9% after closing at $103.85. The stock has gained 17.7% so far this year.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed over $28,000 as investors seemed to respond to mildly encouraging first-quarter earnings from tech giants Google's parent Alphabet and Microsoft and the liquidation of a number of bitcoin short positions.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading over $28,250, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours. BTC had traded sideways most of Tuesday before its surge shortly about the time U.S. equities markets closed. (TradingView)

BTCâs late surge came as Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft both slightly surpassed analystsâ expectations and data from analytics firm Coinglass showed that some $11.3 million of BTC short positions had been liquidated since 4 p.m. ET. These types of short squeezes have historically tended to accelerate price jumps.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, followed a similar pattern and rose 1.8% to change hands at around $1,869. ETH slid as low as $1,804 on Tuesday morning, according to CoinDesk data.

Major equity indexes closed in the red Tuesday afternoon a day after embattled First Republic Bank (FRC) said in its quarterly results that it had lost $100 billion in deposits, renewing anxiety about regional banks. Last month, Silicon Valley and Signature banks both imploded. On Tuesday, First Republicâs shares plummeted almost 50%.

The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.5% and 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 1% for the day.

In bond markets, the yield on the two-year Treasury note sank 19 basis points to 3.94%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped roughly 11 basis points to 3.40%.

""This deep into earnings season, it seems the outlook isnât too bad and that should mean the [Federal Reserve] can stay on their tightening course with the risks of a June hike still remaining on the table,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note.

Story continues

âAfter this round of earnings and the latest consumer confidence report, the one thing that everyone can agree upon is that personal consumption is going to be a lot weaker going forward,â Moya added.

In an email to CoinDesk, Stefan Rust, CEO of data aggregator Truflation, struck an upbeat note, writing that current macroeconomic uncertainties, including the ongoing debate about monetary policy, have again underlined cryptoâs potential.

âThis is the time for crypto to shine against all this adversity, regulations, compliance/obedience while the fiat world is struggling with debt, bank concentration and this shift to a multipolarized world with so much mistrust against institutions and lack of guidance and leadership from politicians,â Rust wrote.

He added: âIf not now, crypto will just become another technology providing rails for the existing systems they want to subject to compliance so that incumbents can maintain and manage incremental transitions, versus leapfrog into a new modern age of financial innovation without middlemen.â"
41,2023-06-16T14:01:58+00:00,"Markets Close at Session Lows: Good Earnings for MSFT, GOOGL &amp; More","Markets opened lower this morning, and that turned out to be the session highs on all four major indices. Market participants resumed pricing in either recession fears â based on some weaker-than-expected results from First Republic FRC yesterday afternoon and UPS UPS this morning â or that inflation will be sticky enough to disallow any Fed interest rate cuts after it presumably reaches its plateau next month. Odds are firming rapidly that another 25 basis-point (bps) hike to the Fed funds rate a week from tomorrow will set the highest interest rate levels in over 15 years.

The Dow shed -334 points on the day, -0.99%, while the Nasdaq gave up -236 points of its own, -1.97%. The S&P 500 split the difference on the session, -1.57%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 got buried -2.40% today. This moves the five-day trading average to negative across the board. For the month, only the Russell has crossed into the red, where it has also gone year to date as of todayâs closing bell.

No rest for the weary, as they say: earnings reports among industry leaders are out in rapid succession this afternoon. Microsoft MSFT has reported fiscal Q3 results with typical beats on both top and bottom lines: earnings of $2.45 per share is notably above the $2.22 expected and reported in the year-ago quarter, while revenues of $52.86 billion surpassed the $50.95 billion in the Zacks consensus. The software giant has only missed on earnings once in the past five years.

Azure revenues came roughly in-line with expectations at +27% (though this illustrates notable deceleration within the companyâs cloud-based business overall). Office Commercial came in +13% (+17% constant currency; Microsoft does a ton of business overseas), and Office Consumer â which was negative last quarter â came in +1% (+4% constant currency). Shares are up +4.8% after hours, pushing the stock higher than +15% year to date.

Google parent Alphabet GOOGL also outperformed expectations on both earnings and sales in its Q1 report after the close. Earnings of $1.17 per share outstrode the $1.06 analysts were looking for, though not quite to the $1.23 per share the company reported a year ago. Revenues, subtracting traffic acquisition costs (TAC), came in at $58.07 billion for the quarter, better than the $57.20 billion expected (GOOGL reported $69.8 billion, without TAC removed).

In its first profitable quarter in its cloud space, revenues there were a tad light of estimates: $7.45 billion versus $7.49 billion expected. YouTube was slightly stronger than expected in the quarter, $6.7 billion versus $6.6 billion estimated. The company also announced a $70 billion share buyback, though Alphabet appears to be less aggressive in reducing overhead by laying off staff, at least compared to companies like Meta META.

Chipotle CMG posted an impressive beat on the bottom line in its Q1 report: earnings of $10.50 per share swept past the $8.89 in the Zacks consensus, whereas revenues of $2.37 billion outpaced the estimated $2.34 billion for the quarter. Comps came aheads of expectations as well: +10.9% versus +8.6%. Operating Margins also performed better, partly on lower prices for avocados and delivery costs. CMG shares are up +6.3% in late trading, +30% year to date.

Visa V, a company that literally does not miss on earnings expectations, beat once again in its fiscal Q2 report â $2.09 versus the consensus $1.97 per share, favorable to the year-ago quarterâs $1.79. Revenues in the quarter also solidly beat estimates: $7.99 billion versus $7.74 billion, for +11% revenue growth year over year. If consumers have slowed down use of their credit cards, thereâs very little evidence here: Payments Volume was +10%, cross-border (indicating overseas card use) beat expectations, +32% in the quarter.

Texas Instruments TXN makes it a clean sweep: earnings of $1.85 per share outperformed the Zacks consensus $1.76, though below the $2.35 per share reported a year ago, while revenues came in at $4.38 billion, slightly ahead of the $4.36 billion expected, which was still -11% year over year. Guidance for next quarter tightened up a bit, putting the midpoint of Zacksâ previous revenue guidance toward the high end of what the company expects now, as T.I. sees weakness across all end-markets, aside from autos.

The recent earnings calls of Google, also known as Alphabet, and Microsoft have sparked discussions on their performance, with some analysts pointing out that Google's call was a ""snooze fest"" compared to Microsoft's high-energy, AI-focused presentation, said Howley.

Yahoo Finance put out a poll on Twitter to ask their viewers on who they think is winning the AI race. Daniel Howley reveals the results that might surprise you. Watch the video to learn more.

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Well, we've got to keep it moving, keep it rolling along here. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley to get his take on what took place between both of these calls. Dan had-- kind of one headphone in for Microsoft, one headphone in for-- for Alphabet. Dan, what did you gather?

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, I think it's just a tale of two calls, almost, where Google was kind of a snooze fest. Microsoft, it sounded like they were all mainlining Red Bull the entire time. Super amped on the AI discussion. And I think if you look at how both companies are trading right now, that's kind of what you would expect based on those calls.

Microsoft up more than 8%. Google just up 1%, and they actually had fallen back pretty significantly from when they initially announced. You know, a lot of AI talk on Microsoft's side. Google, really I think the big thing is, you know, they're continued to improvements, rather, at ad sales space. And, you know, sure, they're going to have to talk about AI as well. But, you know, it just still feels really like Microsoft is continuing to-- to dominate this conversation as far as AI goes.

And, you know, I just want to go real quick to what we're seeing from-- from folks on Twitter as far as the AI aspect goes. We asked some of our readers, who is winning the race so far? And 56%--

BRAD SMITH: Oh.

DANIEL HOWLEY: --so far say Microsoft. You know, that's-- it's just getting--

SEANA SMITH: Wow, that's closer than I thought it was going to be.

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, Google getting kind of blown away at 34%. And then Baidu and, you know, Bibi Baba-- Alibaba down at 3.5%. Not sure anybody's really kind of clocking those as much, but people on Twitter really--

BRAD SMITH: Oh, put some respect on Ernie's name, Dan. [INAUDIBLE]

DANIEL HOWLEY: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I [? keep-- ?] people on Twitter, you know, they're kind of saying, look, you know, Google had sales of a measly 3% year over year, basically saying, look, they-- the bar was low. They did well. Big deal.

Others saying that, look, both Microsoft and Google beat on earnings. That's really good, so the tech story is still alive.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. Just lastly here, Dan, as we're taking a look at the results of that poll, I got to know who you voted for.

DANIEL HOWLEY: I think Microsoft right now, man. It's-- it's hard to vote against them. They're doing pretty good."
49,2023-06-16T11:50:55+00:00,"Asian stocks dip on economic jitters, tech buoyed by strong results","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks fell on Wednesday amid persistent fears of an economic slowdown this year, although technology-heavy indexes were aided by consensus-beating results from major U.S. firms.

Hong Kongâs Hang Seng index was the sole outlier for the day, rising 0.7% on gains in U.S.-exposed technology stocks such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) (NASDAQ:BIDU).

While Wall Street indexes closed lower on Tuesday, first-quarter results from Microsoft Corporation(NASDAQ:MSFT) (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), released after the bell, beat market expectations.

The two stocks also rose in aftermarket trade, as the results highlighted less pressure on mega-cap technology earnings from rising interest rates and high inflation.

Other technology-heavy Asian indexes also saw relatively lower losses, with South Koreaâs KOSPI trading flat, while the Taiwan Weighted index lost 0.3%. India's BSE Sensex 30 and Nifty 50 indexes were also flat in early trade, aided by strength in heavyweight technology stocks.

But broader Asian markets fell on Wednesday as growing fears of a U.S. recession this year largely eroded sentiment towards risk-driven markets. Fears of a banking crisis were also revived by soft results from First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), which flagged plummeting deposit levels.

Focus is now on U.S. GDP data due on Thursday, which is expected to show that growth slowed in the first quarter.

Risk-heavy Southeast Asian markets fell the most, with Thailandâs SET Index and the Philippine Composite down 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively.

Chinaâs Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, amid continued concerns over an uneven economic recovery in the country. Focus is now on data on Chinese industrial profits, due on Thursday to gauge the state of the manufacturing sector, which has struggled to recover despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures.

Story continues

Australiaâs ASX 200 fell 0.1%, as inflation data showed that price pressures remained sticky in the first quarter of the year - a trend that could invite more interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank.

Japanâs Nikkei 225 index fell 0.7%, although the index fared much better than its Asian peers this week as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated his intention to keep policy ultra-loose in the near-term.

Focus is now on an inflation reading, as well as a BOJ meeting on Friday to gauge when the central bank could begin tightening policy later this year.

50,2023-06-16T11:45:00+00:00,"Compared to Estimates, Alphabet (GOOGL) Q1 Earnings: A Look at Key Metrics","For the quarter ended March 2023, Alphabet (GOOGL) reported revenue of $58.07 billion, up 3.7% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $1.17, compared to $1.23 in the year-ago quarter.

The reported revenue compares to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, representing a surprise of +1.54%. The company delivered an EPS surprise of +10.38%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $1.06.

While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.

Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.

Here is how Alphabet performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:

Total traffic acquisition costs: $11.72 billion versus the 11-analyst average estimate of $11.81 billion. Headcount: 190711 versus the four-analyst average estimate of 176935.2. Revenue- EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa): $21.08 billion versus $20.74 billion estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +3.8% change. Revenue- US-Total: $32.86 billion versus $32.75 billion estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +3.6% change. Revenue- Other Americas (Canada and Latin America): $4.08 billion compared to the $3.85 billion average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of +6.2% year over year. Revenue- APAC (Asia-Pacific): $11.68 billion compared to the $12.24 billion average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of -1.4% year over year. Revenue- Google Advertising- Total: $54.55 billion versus the 10-analyst average estimate of $53.78 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of -0.2%. Revenue- Google properties: $47.05 billion versus $46.02 billion estimated by 10 analysts on average. Revenue- Google Network: $7.50 billion compared to the $7.76 billion average estimate based on 10 analysts. The reported number represents a change of -8.3% year over year. Revenue- Google other: $7.41 billion compared to the $7.13 billion average estimate based on nine analysts. The reported number represents a change of +8.8% year over year. Revenues- Google Services- Total: $61.96 billion versus $60.90 billion estimated by nine analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +0.8% change. Revenue- Google Search & other: $40.36 billion versus the nine-analyst average estimate of $39.35 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +1.9%.

In their respective earnings calls on Tuesday, the tech giants, which are becoming rivals in the competition for the future of search, offered up starkly different assessments of just how much disruption is in store for the market. Google executives encouraged investors to trust in the companyâs long track record as the worldâs leading search engine, and framed AI as just another shift in its constantly evolving business. Microsoft suggested that something much more dramatic is underway.

Investors seemed to like Microsoftâs thesis better, sending its shares up as much as 9.7% in extended trading, while Alphabet increased less than 2%.

Until recently, Google was viewed as all but invincible in the market for online search, which it dominates worldwide. That changed with the debut of OpenAIâs wildly popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Microsoft has begun weaving OpenAIâs technology into its Bing search engine, and the partnership has ratcheted up pressure on Google to reinvent its core search business to allow for more of the conversational exchanges that generative AI makes possible.

Speaking to analysts, Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai stressed that Google is investing heavily in AI, yet he downplayed what the technology would mean for the search advertising business, which remains the companyâs lifeblood. He expressed optimism that users will continue to value online advertising even if their searches yield a summary composed by a large language model, rather than the familiar list of links that Google has long delivered.

âThroughout the years, we have gone through many, many shifts in search,â Pichai said. âAnd as we have evolved search, I think weâve always had a strong, grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well.â

Yet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested his company is a formidable challenger. He said app installations have quadrupled since the launch of the AI-powered Bing in February. He added that Bing took share in the US market in the quarter, without offering specific metrics.

âWe look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category â search,â Nadella said on the companyâs earnings call.

Billions of dollars in revenue could be up for grabs with even relatively small changes in market share. But in the past quarter, at least, Googleâs search business appeared to be weathering the heightened competitive threats and a broader downturn in the digital advertising market. The companyâs revenue from search and related businesses rose to almost $40.4 billion in the period ended March 31, besting analystsâ estimates.

As Google moves to incorporate generative AI into search, Pichai said the company would draw on its institutional knowledge. âWeâll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality,â Pichai said. âAnd weâll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information.â

Yet the company has ample reason to be worried, said Max Willens, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.

âGoogleâs core business is facing the most serious challenges it has encountered in quite some time,â Willens wrote in a note.

Googleâs partnerships with manufacturers of Android phones present another opportunity for Microsoft to gain ground. Yet there, too, Pichai suggested that Googleâs long track record will win the day.

âWhen we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience,â Pichai said. âAnd ultimately, partners end up choosing us because thatâs what their users want.â

54,2023-06-16T04:00:58+00:00,"Tech CEOs wax poetic on AI, big adds to sales will take time","By Noel Randewich and Akash Sriram

(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Google-parent Alphabet Inc talked up investments in artificial intelligence (AI) for the second quarter in a row but their results on Tuesday suggested that any substantial additions to sales will be slow.

The tech behemoths have launched an array of products that they promise are packed with generative AI, which creates brand new content - text, image, code - from past data. The term became a buzzword after Microsoft-backed firm OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that writes human-like responses.

""The world's most advanced AI models are coming together with the world's most universal user interface - natural language - to create a new era of computing,"" Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive officer, said in a statement on Tuesday. (Graphic: Alphabet and Microsoft talk up AI, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/AI/lgvdkajbepo/chart.png)

With quarterly reporting season just under way, the term ""AI"" has been used nearly twice as frequently in the conference calls of S&P 500 companies as it was in the previous quarter, a Reuters analysis showed.

Google used the term 52 times on its first-quarter call on Tuesday, up from 45 in the fourth quarter. Microsoft said it 36 times, versus 20 - not including references to its partner OpenAI.

Both companies said AI was already juicing sales, but neither said when or if they would start breaking out any sales, costs, or profits from the technology.

""Lots more to come,"" Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai said on Tuesday, after he mentioned some of the products the company launched last month, including Bard, Google's answer to ChatGPT-powered Microsoft search chatbot Bing.

Google, which has also unveiled a flurry of AI tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, reported quarterly profit and revenue above estimates and said it would buy back $70 billion in stock.

It said last week it would combine its AI research units Google Brain and DeepMind and work on ""multimodal"" AI, like OpenAI's latest model GPT-4, which can respond not only to text prompts but to image inputs as well to generate new content.

""I mean the announcements are there and things will move quickly. But I think it's going to take some time to see real meaty results,"" said Thomas Martin, a senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.

""As far as working it into actual numbers ... think about how long it took for Google to break out YouTube just as an example,"" he said, adding that anything significant was unlikely to show up on statements for more than a year.

Brett Iversen, Microsoft's head of investor relations, told Reuters, however, that ""it's really early"" and that AI was still a relatively small part of Microsoft's total business. (Graphic: AI dominates quarterly conference calls, https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/AI/gdvzqbkgmpw/chart.png)

BIG PLAYERS

Nadella said in the three months since Microsoft made a new AI ""Copilot"" developer tool broadly available, over 10,000 organizations had signed up, including Coca-Cola and General Motors. The tool is for its product suite that includes Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and Outlook emails.

Microsoft beat estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Tuesday, driven by growth in its cloud computing and Office productivity software businesses.

Bing has lagged Google search for decades but Nadella said that Bing downloads had jumped since the addition of AI features and now had 100 million daily users.

""Ultimately, it may be a much larger of an impact to Microsoft's enterprise software and perhaps less so in search,"" said Haruki Toyama, portfolio manager at Madison Investments.

Toyama said Google already used AI to monetize their search algorithms and he did not expect AI advances from its rivals to be as much of a threat as some thought.

Meta Platforms Inc, which reports results on Wednesday, and Amazon.com Inc, which reports next week, have also jumped onto the AI bandwagon.

Meta, which has admitted it is playing catch-up in AI, has published an AI model that can pick out individual objects from within an image. Amazon's cloud division AWS, the world's largest, has released a suite of technologies aimed at helping other companies develop their own chatbots backed by AI.

Shares in Meta and Amazon rose 2.3% and 5.3% on Tuesday after market, respectively.

Google advertising, search and other revenue revenue grew 2 percent year over year in the first quarter, pushed upwards by increases in revenue from travel and retail ads.

âIn Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2 percent year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance,â Alphabet Chief Operating Officer Philipp SchindlerÂ told financial analysts Tuesday as Googleâs parent company publicized its first quarter financial results.

That reversed a 1.6 percent revenue decline in these categories in the fourth quarter, which ended December 31.

Schindler said excluding currency headwinds, revenue trends for search advertising were actually similar in the first quarter versus the previous quarter.

âIâd say maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects whatâs being reported elsewhere, and across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pullback at budgets as well,â Schindler said.

On Tuesday, Google touted a year-old hotel advertising tool, Performance Max, which enables hotels to create digital ads in multiple formats to reach travelers across six of its ad channels, namely YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, Gmail and Maps, as being particularly effective.

Online travel agencies, which often have more marketing resources, might prefer to create channel-specific campaigns, but Performance Max for hotels streamlines the multi-channel creative process.

Carita Hotels Group in Indonesia saw a 32 percent revenue increase, and a 26 percent rise in direct bookings after using the Performance Max tool for one month, Schindler said.

âThereâs more to come here as we add even more AI â¦ features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May,â he said.

Attracting direct bookings, rather than relying on online travel agencies with their relatively high commissions, is often a key goal for hospitality companies.

Story continues

A substantial chunk of the call with analysts revolved around the launch of Googleâs generative AI chatbot, Bard, and the companyâs focus on further developments.

âGoogle currently holds more than 90 percent of search market share,â CNBC reported. â[CEO Sundar] Pichai said heâs comfortable that Google will continue to improve search and will be competitive in the big dealsâ with cellphone manufacturers such as Samsung and Apple as Google competes with Microsoftâs Bing and ChatGPT.

Saddled with restricting and severance costs tied to layoffs several months ago, Alphabet saw its net income fall 8.4 percent year over year to $15.05 billion. Total revenue rose 2.6 percent year over year to $69.78 billion.

April 25 (Reuters) - Montana Governor Greg Gianforte is seeking to broaden a bill that will ban not just TikTok, but other social media applications that provide certain data to foreign adversaries, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

Earlier this month, Montana lawmakers passed a bill, known as SB 419, to ban TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, from operating in the state.

TikTok as well as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, which operate mobile app stores, would face fines if they violate the ban, should the bill become law.

The governor's proposed language in the broader bill removes app stores from being held liable for offering such social media apps for downloading in the state, WSJ said, citing an amended draft of the bill.

TikTok is facing growing calls from some U.S. lawmakers to ban the app nationwide over concerns about potential Chinese government influence over the platform.

The short-form video app has repeatedly denied that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and has said the company would not do so if asked.

The governor's office and TikTok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. (Reporting by Jahnavi Nidumolu in Bengaluru; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Michael Perry)"

Presentation

Operator

Good day, and welcome to the Netlist First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Smargiassi. Please go ahead..

Michael Smargiassi

Thank you, Dave. And good day, everyone. Welcome to Netlist's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Leading today's call will be Chuck Hong, Chief Executive Officer of Netlist; and Gail Sasaki, Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, the earnings release and a replay of today's call can be accessed on the Investors section of the Netlist website at netlist.com. 
Before we start the call, I would note that today's presentation of Netlist results and answers to questions may include forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. The actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of the number of risks and uncertainties and that are expressed in the call, annual and current SEC filings and the cautionary statements contained in the press release today. Netlist assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
I would now like to turn the call over to Chuck.

Chun Ki Hong

Good morning. Thanks, Mike. We apologize for the slight delay this morning with some technical difficulties that we had. So let's get on with the call. 
Last week, Netlist concluded this jury trial against Samsung in the Eastern District of Texas. The case addressed Samsung's infringement of 5 Netlist patents on 3 strategic product categories: DDR4 LRDIMMs, all families of DR5 DIMMs and high-bandwidth memory or HBM. Some brief descriptions about these products in order to better understand the scope and size of the coverage of Netlist patents. 
DDR4 LRDIMM is the highest speed and highest capacity memory for DDR4 servers manufacturer today, and it was invented by Netlist over a decade ago. DDR5 DIMMs are the next generation of memory that just started to ship in volume and will be in production over the next decade. 
Years ago, Netlist created the intelligent on DIMM power management system that allows DDR5 DIMMs to perform at higher speeds than the prior generation of DDR4 and DDR3 DIMMs while using less power. Netlist's power management technologies are now being deployed in the high-end memory use for enterprise applications as well as in the commodity grade memory used in all PCs operating with DDR5 memory. 
HBM is an acronym for high-bandwidth memory, which is a technology that enables efficient 3-dimensional stacking of multiples of memory array die vertically to achieve an overall higher capacity. As the industry's push of traditional planar DRAM towards higher densities are constrained by the limits of physics, more and more HBMs are being used to reach the needed capacities. Netlist's unique and proprietary array stacking technologies allow HBMs to operate at lower electrical load and higher speeds while dramatically increasing their overall component capacities. Indeed, HBMs are critical to the operations of all high-bandwidth compute tasks, including complex modeling driven by the latest cutting-edge GPUs or large-scale AI-based systems like ChatGPT. 
Samsung has touted both DDR5 and HBM memory as their focal points for the future of their memory business. And collectively, these categories will likely account for the vast majority of Samsung's DRAM product revenues in the coming years. Both segments are very early in their product life cycles. 
Now on to the trial. The 6-day trial resulted in a unanimous jury verdict and a decisive victory on all counts. The jury awarded Netlist $303 million in damages award against Samsung for their infringement. The verdict confirmed that all 5 Netlist patents had been infringed by Samsung, that none of Netlist's 5 patents were invalid, and Samsung willfully infringed those patents and that money damages were owed to Netlist for the infringement of all 5 patents. 
The damages' award was comprised of 3 components. First, the 339 patent, which read on DDR4 LRDIMMs, for the period of December 2021 through March 2023 and the sale of 610,000 units of infringing product, the jury awarded Netlist $33.2 million from Samsung. 
Second, for the 918 and the 054 patents, which read on DDR5 UDIMMs, SODIMMs and RDIMMS, for the period of December '21 through March 2023 on the 918 patent and then January 2022 through March 2023 on the 054 patent, the jury awarded at Netlist $147.2 million or Samsung sale of 9.3 million units combined of all DDR5 DIMMs. And again, DIMMs stands for dual in-line memory module. 
And third, for the 060 and 160 patents, which read on HBMs, for the 10-month period only between May 2022 to March 2023, the jury awarded Netlist $12.8 million for Samsung sale of $7.3 million of HBM2, HBM2E and HBM3 components. 
The trial clearly highlighted the tremendous value of Netlist's patents and the unique solutions we provide. In fact, the jury saw evidence confirming that under oath, many Samsung engineers could not point to a single commercially viable alternative for making the infringing products other than relying on Netlist's patented technologies, nor could they point to any of the thousands of Samsung patents as covering the inventions claimed in Netlist 5 patents. We believe that these were critical pieces of evidence in the trial and a qualitative validation of the unique innovation Netlist created years ago. 
In terms of next steps, the court will enter a final judgment following its assessment of post-trial procedures and filings. As all instances of infringement were found to be local, Chief Judge Gilstrap has the opportunity to enhance the damages awarded by the jury. This is a decision at the judge's sole discretion. 
There are avenues available to Samsung to appeal the jury's verdict. This is something we expect them to do and are prepared for. The deadline for anyone to file a notice of appeal is 30 days from the date of the entry of the final judgment, but that will necessarily follow post-trial briefings, which we believe will likely take few weeks. 
As this ruling covers damages up to March of this year, Samsung is currently operating using Netlist technology without a license on these strategic products. As always, we remain open to discuss licensing of our patents with Samsung and any other party currently using our technology without permission. In light of this synthetic ruling, we expect to engage in more substantive bilateral discussions that build upon the attempts we've made in the past. 
Moving on to other IP-related actions, I'll now provide you a quick update that are part of Netlist's global enforcement efforts. The case against Micron in the Eastern District of Texas, which is also before Judge Gilstrap and address infringement for the patents that were part of the just conclude Samsung trial, remains on schedule. Claim construction is set for July 19 this year, with the jury trial currently set to begin on January 22, 2024. 
In the second set of cases against Samsung and Micron in the Eastern District of Texas, which were consolidated to streamline the pretrial process, each case involves the 912 patent and its related child patents while the Samsung case also includes Netlist's patent #608 relating to DDR4 LRDIMMs. The addition of the 608 patent has already survived Samsung's IPR attach as the PTAB decided the Samsung's invalidity arguments did not have a reasonable likelihood of success. Claim constructions are set for October 5, 2023, and jury trial are currently set to begin on April 15, 2024. 
In Germany, the infringement hearing for the Samsung case is set for September and Google hearing for November. The Micron hearing on EP660 is set for next week on May 4. And EP660 is the European analog to the U.S. 339 patent that was just the subject of our trial against Samsung in Texas and relates to DDR4 LRDIMMs technologies. 
Finally, in regards to the 912 patents IPR proceedings, as we reported on our last call, U.S. PTO Director Vidal entered a decision in February that require the assigned PTAB board to reevaluate Netlist's request for discovery on the admitted relationship between Samsung and Google. This process has begun. Earlier this month, Netlist filed an opening brief as part of this new discovery process set by the PTAB per Director Vidal's decision. Netlist and Samsung have since exchanged several such briefs, the content of which the Board will take under advisement as it reconsiders its previous decisions to institute an IPR claim against Claim 16 of our 912 patent. The last brief from Samsung is due May 3, 2023. Accordingly, we anticipate that the Board will reach a final decision in the next month or so. Meanwhile, the underlying IPR process has been stayed by Director Vidal while the question of whether Google is a real party of interest is reconsidered. 
Lastly, I would like to thank the team at [Aral] and Manila for their tireless advocacy in the recently concluded Samsung case and the ongoing support of our investor base. 
Now I'll take -- I'll turn the call over to Gail for the financial review.

Gail M. Sasaki

Thanks, Chuck. During the 3 months that ended April 1, 2023, total revenue was $9 million from $50.2 million the prior quarter of Q1 '22. Gross profit dollars were $0.6 million from $3.4 million in the year ago period, and gross margin was 6.2% for Q1 '23 compared to 7.7% in the prior year's quarter. The increase in operating expense for the first quarter was due to increased legal expense related to the number of active campaigns and recent jury trial. We do expect label costs to remain elevated through the rest of 2023. 
First quarter product revenue and product margin results reflect the ongoing downturn in the market due to memory industry oversupply and a very soft demand environment. The combination of which has also resulted in price pressure. Industry experts anticipate a continuation of the current market dynamics near term with the hope of some easing towards the end of the year. That said, the long-term outlook for the overall memory market remains very optimistic. 
Netlist is actively participating in qualifications in preparation for sale of new DDR5-based servers, and we believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on the strategic SK hynix relationship as the market improves. As a reminder, we do not formally guide. But given the lack of visibility and market dynamics as noted earlier, we currently expect our Q2 '23 product revenue to be less than Q1 '23. 
We continue to maintain strong cost controls and are proactively managing the business given the current market outlook. This included the previously announced reduction in force in January. We ended Q1 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $36.6 million compared to $43.6 million at the end of 2022. During the quarter, we proactively raised approximately $10.5 million under the $75 million equity line of credit with close to $49 million remaining on the line. As always, we continue to very carefully manage the operational cash cycle, which for Q1 '23 was an improvement of 119 days compared to last year's Q1. 
Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Suji Desilva with ROTH Capital.

Suji Desilva

Quick questions, first of all, on the litigation. Can you talk about with Samsung with the appeal coming and so forth, what are -- what is the time line for kind of the -- kind of follow-through on the findings of the court of the damages?

Chun Ki Hong

Suji, yes, as stated in the prepared remarks, the post-trial activity to get to a final judge's ruling will take a few weeks. And then after that, they'll have 30 days to appeal. So that's a predictable thing that they will appeal. But thus far, we have -- we are confident in the jury verdict, and we have no reason to believe that there are any substantive things that they can point to in this vertical or in the trial.

Suji Desilva

Okay. All right, Chuck. And then can you just talk about the, I guess, the next Micron/Google combined case and how that's similar and different? I'm sorry, Micron and Samsung case and how that's similar or different to the Samsung case?

Chun Ki Hong

There are 2 separate cases. There is a separate case against Micron. That is -- that will start sometime middle of the year with claim construction. Some of the activities will start over the next couple of months. And those cover many of the patents that were asserted in this last case against Samsung and cover effectively similar technologies, DDR5, power management, LRDIMMs and high-bandwidth memory. So we'll be in front of the same court, and it will be the same team from our size. Every case is unique, but -- and has its own set of facts. But in general, there will be similar patents covering similar technologies. So that is against Micron. 
And then there is a second case against Micron and Samsung on a different set of patents that cover the current high-volume products that are at DDR4. So you can look at the trial, the case against Samsung that just concluded really for -- as covering technologies that are just at their inception, and that will go on for the next decade. That's DDR5 and HBM. These are very strategic technologies for Samsung as well as the other major memory suppliers. 
And then we can look at the second set of patents that are asserted in the combined case against Samsung and Micron as covering the current high-volume products that they are shipping today and going back the last 4, 5 years.

Suji Desilva

Okay. Great. And then as to the upcoming Google case, can you talk about the differences there as well and the time frame and what are the next milestones to watch for?

Chun Ki Hong

The Google case in the Northern District of California has been stayed pending the outcome of the second case against Samsung. There is -- the judge determined that there was a relationship there. So Google case, we also have a case against Google in the District of Delaware. That's a combined case against Samsung and Google, and that's the third case that now I'm talking about. 
Google has its own particular exposure, which we believe to be significant based on its own manufacturing of memory modules over a period of what we believe to be some 10 years going back starting in the 2010. So that's their own specific exposure, and that's the case against them in the Northern District that we filed. 
And then they've got also separate exposure if they're currently buying from Samsung, and they do buy extensively from Samsung. Those products are unlicensed products. So patent infringement obviously has to do with people that are not licensed that are building and supplying product, but also people who are knowingly buying from suppliers and sources that are unlicensed and infringing on others' intellectual property. So there's 2 sets of exposure for Google, and those are involved in 2 separate cases: one against Google alone in the Northern District of California and one against Google and Samsung in the District of Delaware.

Suji Desilva

Okay. Chuck, appreciate that clarification. Last question. If I take just a simple division of the damages by the patents and then the number of units you talked about in the prepared remarks, the time frame probably is not as relevant there. Is that a proxy for the royalty rate that could be applied across these cases? Or is there something specific about the Samsung damages case that might make that calculation not particularly accurate there?

Chun Ki Hong

Well, that is the jury's calculation and their decisions. So that is the simple math. If we want to get to a per unit royalty, reasonable per unit royalty as determined by this jury, yes, you basically do simple math, simple division of the total damages that were awarded by the number of units that were shipped over that period of time. 
I think what is relevant in terms of the period of time is it was a relatively short period of time, about anywhere between 1 year and 1.5 years depending on the patent and the products, and that was determined by the judge at the outset of trial. Now what is important to note is that those volumes for those products. 
LRDIMM, notwithstanding LRDIMM DDR4 is a fairly mature product that has been shipping for now 5, 6, 7 years. But HBM, particularly for Samsung, which is late to the game compared to hynix, hynix owns about 70% of the HBM market, but Samsung is therefore quickly trying to catch up. The HBM volumes as well as the DDR5 product volumes are really -- now it's -- they're probably the top of the first inning. It's a baseball analogy in terms of where they are in their life cycle.

Suji Desilva

Okay. Congrats on the findings from Texas.

Hereâs a look at some of the stocks investors are watching on Wednesday, 26 April.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Shares in Microsoft rose after the software giant's fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of $2.45 (Â£1.96) beat Wall Street estimates of $2.23 on Tuesday.

Revenue of $52.9bn came in above expectations of $51.02bn, despite a continued slowdown in the company's cloud revenue.

The tech giant said revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 27% year-over-year for the quarter. That number has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022, as a result of companies trimming their capital expenses due to rising interest rates.

Microsoft is seen by investors as one of the most obvious winners in the rapidly emerging AI market, with its stock up 17% this year.

Microsoft helped kick off Big Tech's AI obsession with its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

Traders are betting that AI adoption will help Microsoft challenge the market dominance of Google.

âThe world's most advanced AI models are coming together with the world's most universal user interface â natural language â to create a new era of computing,â Satya Nadella, Microsoftâs chief executive said in a statement.

âAcross the Microsoft Cloud, we are the platform of choice to help customers get the most value out of their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI.â

Alphabet (GOOGL)

Alphabet stock rose as much as 5% in after hours trading on Tuesday after its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday beat expectations on the top- and bottom-lines.

The tech giantâs Google Cloud unit turned a profit for the first time while revenue in this segment grew by 28%.

It also reported that its YouTube ad revenue was $6.69bn â a decline of 2.6% year-over-year. However, it slightly beat analyst expectations of $6.6bn. It comes as the video platform continues to navigate a soft ad market.

The company also revealed a number of charges related to its efforts to rein in costs, including $2.6bn linked to the Alphabet's layoffs and office space cutbacks.

Investors were also across the companiesâ outlook on artificial intelligence. Google's AI capabilities were recently questioned by some as the company's AI chatbot, Bard, failed to impress.

""We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation,"" Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet and Google, said in a statement.

Losses related to the company's AI efforts totaled $3.3bn during the first quarter.

First Republic (FRC)

Investors will be keeping across shares in First Republic after its stock fell a massive 49% on the back of dire first-quarter earnings from the embattled lender.

Investors reacted after the US bank said customers had pulled more than $100bn (Â£80bn) from their accounts in the three months ending 31 March.

""With the closure of several banks in March, we experienced unprecedented deposit outflows,"" the San Francisco-based bank's CFO Neal Holland said.

It follows last monthâs banking crisis in which First Republic was seen as one of the banks most at risk of failure, after other collapses in the sector.

It was stabilised by a multi-billion dollar rescue deal with help from Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo.

However, First Republic noted that the situation had since stabilised and said it was pursuing ""strategic options"" to strengthen its position, including cutting costs by shedding 20% to 25% of its workforce in the coming months.

""We're taking steps to meaningfully reduce our expenses to align with our focus on reducing the size of the balance sheet,"" Chief executive Mike Roffler said in a post-earnings briefing.

Meta (META)

First-quarter earnings from Meta Platforms are due after the US market close later.

After a challenging 2022, Metaâs shares became one of the top performers this year, up 75% year-to-date â and its stock rebounded more than 140% from its November low.

âThe company was criticised for its excessive spending on the Reality Labs, or so-called Metaverse. Following a slew of cost-saving measures, such as widespread job cuts and payroll expense reductions, the company expects to return growth in revenue after a three straight quarterly decline,â Tina Teng, market analyst at CMC Markets, said.

Metaâs full-year revenue growth in 2022 declined by 1% to $116.61bn. Its cost in Reality Labs was $13.72bn.

The company, however, has insisted on devoting 20% of its overall costs and expense to Reality Labs in 2023.

âMeta Platforms recently announced the second round of job cuts of 10,000 after 11,000 workforce layoffs in November, with an aim to reduce expenses by $5 billion from its prior outlook to between $89 billion and $95 billion this year,â Teng added.

The CMC markets analyst further noted that the companyâs revenue guidance is between $26bn and $28.5bn in the first quarter with analysts estimating $27.65bn, or a 1% decline from a year ago.

The earnings per share is expected to be $2.03, or a 25% drop annually.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L)

Shares in GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) were trading down nearly 2% in morning London trade on the FTSE 100 after the company posted a trading update.

âGSK reported first quarter adjusted profit of 37 pence per share, beating analystsâ expectations for 33.2 pence while revenue hit Â£7 billion, also topping estimates for Â£6.5 billion,â Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.

The pharma giant also confirmed its 2023 full-year guidance for sales and earnings on Wednesday and highlighted that its shingles vaccine drug Shingrix had generated sales of Â£833m, beating consensus forecasts.

âMany investors have been shifting towards defensive sectors like pharmaceuticals this year amid the sluggish economic backdrop, providing a tailwind for stocks like GSK which is up over 7% in the past six months,â Scholar added.

She also noted that it was still underperforming, however, reflecting investor concerns about the strength of GSKâs drug pipeline.

âGSK has been pursuing inorganic growth instead, most recently with its acquisition of Bellus Health for $2 billion which offers respiratory drugs,â she added.

63,2023-06-15T16:45:04+00:00,"With its AI edge, Microsoft is eating into Google's search dominance","Becoming a search force to reckon with.

Microsoftâs rapid progress with AI could be giving it a leg up in search on Google, the incumbent titan.

In their first-quarter earnings calls after the bell yesterday (April 25), Alphabet, Googleâs parent company, and Microsoft both anchored their conversation around AI and, as a result, the future of search. Only Microsoft, which is plugging AI into its Bing search engine and suite of Office tools, predicted a dramatic transformationââa generational shift,â in CEO Satya Nadellaâs wordsâthat could put it in the lead.

Meanwhile, Google proposed that AI was just another evolutionary point in its steady domination of search. âThroughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we evolve Search, I think we have always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well,â Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet CEO, said in a call with analysts. âAnd we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users.â

The numbers that both companies disclosed are telling. Googleâs revenues in âsearch and otherâ categories rose 1.87% year-on-year, a far smaller growth than the 24.3% in the same quarter in 2022 and the 30.1% in 2021. Meanwhile, Nadella said that daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown four times since Microsoft bundled AI features into the browserâs search capability.

Thereâs no doubt that Google, which has led the way on search for years, has found itself challenged by Microsoftâs investment in and integration of Open AIâs dialogue-based chatbot over the last six months. Making matters worse, Bard, Googleâs own answer to ChatGPT, didnât get off to a flying start.

Analysts seemed more sold on Microsoftâs narrative. In premarket trading, Microsoftâs share price jumped by a significantly higher measure when compared to that of Alphabet.

A brief timeline of AI moves by Microsoft and Google in 2023

Jan. 16: Microsoft announces the âgeneral availabilityâ of its Azure OpenAI Service, which has been available to a handful of customers since it was first teased in 2021. It includes dialogue-based chatbot GPT-3.5, a natural-language-to-code converter called Codex, and DALLâ¢E 2, which can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.

Jan. 24: Microsoft confirms a third multibillion dollar investment in OpenAI. It doesnât disclose the amount, but a Semafor report pegs it at a whopping $10 billion.

Jan. 31: OpenAI says it has âtrained a classifier to distinguish between text written by a human and text written by AIs.â

Feb. 6: Sundar Pichai, Alphabetâs CEO, announces his company will open Bard, powered by its Language Model for Dialogue Applications (or LaMDA), âto trusted testers,â with the intention of releasing it to the general public shortly afterwards.

Feb. 7: Microsoft hosts a surprise event to reveal a new version of its search engine Bing, developed with OpenAI, which is ârunning on a new next-generation large language model. One that is much more powerful than ChatGPT and that is customized specifically for search,â as per Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoftâs corporate vice president and consumer chief marketing officer.

Feb. 8: Googleâs Bard unveiling event, livestreamed from Paris, falls flat after an incorrect description in an ad for the AI bot dampens excitement.

Mar. 7: Salesforce and OpenAI announce the integration of ChatGPT into Slack. The tool will provide instant summaries of conversations, find answers to questions quickly, and draft messages faster.

Mar. 14: Google announces plans to add generative AI features to Workspace apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

Mar. 15: Microsoft removes the waitlist for its new Bing Chat feature, so anyone can sign up and use the GPT-4-powered chatbot. The next day, Microsoft integrates OpenAIâs technology into its Office tools like Word and Excel.

Mar. 21: Google reveals it is allowing more people to interact with its new service, which had only been available to a small group of âtrusted testersâ handpicked by Google.

Apr. 18: The US Patent and Trademark office dismisses OpenAIâs petition to apply for a trademark for âGPT,â which stands for âGenerative Pretrained Transformer,â citing attorneys failing to pay an associated fee as well as to provide âappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.â

Apr. 19: A damning Bloomberg report reveals that Google employees testing Bard often used choice words to describe it, including calling it âa pathological liar,â âcringeworthy,â and âworse than useless.â

Apr. 20: Google combines its Brain and DeepMind groups into one Google DeepMind organization, in a move that will âsignificantly accelerate our progress in AI,â according to Pichai.

Apr. 25: OpenAI announces that âChatGPT Businessâ is coming soon

Company of interest: Amazon

On April 4, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a 10-week generative AI accelerator program that will aid the âmost promisingâ startups in the sector with cloud credits, mentorship, networking events, and more. At the end, these startups can pitch to investors.

Nine days later, Amazon unveiled a cloud-based generative AI service called Bedrock. Instead of building massive AI models in house, Amazonâs Bedrock will give customers âeasy access to foundation models (FMs)â from top AI startup model providers, which they can customize with their own data and deploy in their apps to build and scale generative AI apps.

One more thing: Cloud is booming for both Google and Microsoft

Alongside âsearch performing well,â Pichai also cited âmomentum in cloudâ as a driving force behind Googleâs performance. After reporting losses for three years, its cloud business is profitable for the first time.

Microsoft is still a formidable competitor in the cloud space, though. Azure revenues jumped 31%. As Amazon Web Services, the market leader, loses ground, Microsoft appears to be gaining more of its share than Google is.

Futures up: Dow 0.10%, S&P 0.43%, Nasdaq 1.25%

April 26 (Reuters) - Nasdaq futures rallied more than 1% on Wednesday after upbeat results from Microsoft and Alphabet dwarfed worries about the impact of rising interest rates on the U.S. economy.

Microsoft Corp climbed 7.5% after it beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly results, and said that artificial intelligence products were stimulating sales.

Alphabet Inc rose 1.0% after the Google parent said it would buy back $70 billion in stock and topped first-quarter profit and revenue estimates on strong demand for cloud services and ad sales.

Wall Street's major averages suffered their deepest declines so far this month on Tuesday as a downbeat UPS forecast exacerbated investor concerns about a slowing U.S. economy while plunging deposits at First Republic Bank added to jitters about the bank sector's health.

Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that reported first-quarter profit through Tuesday, 79% topped analysts' expectations, as per Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 66% companies beat estimates.

Earnings forecasts have also improved, with analysts expecting a 3.9% contraction in first-quarter profit for S&P 500 companies compared with a 5.2% decline estimated at the beginning of the earnings season.

Boeing Co, Boston Scientific Corp and General Dynamics Corp are among the companies set to report results before the opening bell, while Meta Platforms Inc is scheduled to report after market close on Wednesday.

At 5:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 33 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 17.5 points, or 0.43%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 160.75 points, or 1.25%.

Durable goods data for March is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. A key inflation metric as well as U.S. GDP data for the first quarter will be out later in the week.

Data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a nine-month low in April, signalling that the economy could fall into recession this year.

By Naomi Rovnick

LONDON April 26 (Reuters) - Global stock markets were mixed on Wednesday as recession fears and banking sector strain weighed on European stocks and the dollar while Wall Street stock futures firmed on bullish updates from Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.

Europe's STOXX 600 share index fell 0.8% as regional banking stocks dropped by the same amount.

MSCI's broad index of global stocks was steady, after Asian markets outside of Japan closed higher in line with rising Wall Street futures.

The dollar index, which measures the currency against other majors, fell 0.6% in a move that pushed up sterling and the euro.

Shares in troubled San Francisco-based First Republic Bank hit a record low on Tuesday as it disclosed that deposits had plunged by just over $100 billion, reviving fears for smaller U.S. lenders that began with Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in March.

But ahead of quarterly results from Facebook parent Meta Platforms later in the day, Nasdaq futures were up 1.2% on Wednesday morning in Europe and S&P 500 futures gained 0.4%.

Microsoft rose 8% in U.S. pre-market dealings after its quarterly results, issued after the U.S. stock market closed on Tuesday, beat analyst forecasts. A $70 billion share buyback announced by Google parent Alphabet also looked set to insulate the mood on Wall Street from banking sector troubles.

U.S. and European financial conditions have tightened significantly since the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank embarked on their most aggressive interest rate-hiking cycles for decades last year to battle soaring inflation.

This has dented confidence towards loan-dependent sectors such as real estate, and raised questions over how global banks will deal with defaults.

Deposit flight from U.S. banks has prompted investors to dial down profit expectations for the global banking sector, with banks under pressure to raise interest rates on savings accounts to keep hold of customers' money.

""Banks around the world want to make sure their deposits will stay,"" said Jason Da Silva, director of global investment strategy at Arbuthnot Latham in London.

""So there's an expectation in the market that banks' earnings and net interest margins have probably peaked.""

The benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes both fell heavily on Tuesday after weak consumer confidence data, while bonds rallied sharply and interest rate futures markets priced in a higher chance of Fed cuts later in the year.

U.S. 10-year yields fell nearly 12 basis points (bps) on Tuesday, their sharpest drop in more than a month, while steadying about 2 basis points higher at 3.398% on Wednesday morning in Europe.

Germany's 10-year yield slipped 2 bps to 2.375% after dropping 11 bps in the previous session.

Complicating the outlook for bond markets, the cost of insuring against the U.S. government defaulting on its debt rose further on Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that a failure by Congress to lift the debt ceiling would trigger economic catastrophe.

Spreads on five-year U.S. credit default swaps widened to 62 bps, the highest since 2011.

""The chances of U.S. default remain very, very slim,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group. ""However, it just takes the probabilities to rise above zero and it becomes a real issue from an investor perspective.""

In currency markets, the euro gained 0.8% to $1.1062. Sterling gained 0.6% to $1.249.

The yen was steady at 133.4 per dollar ahead of the Bank of Japan's meeting this week, as markets await clues from new governor Kazuo Ueda about whether he might ditch policies that have suppressed domestic bond yields and the yen.

Brent crude futures fell a further 0.3% to $80.56 a barrel, having dropped almost 4% overnight with the risk-averse mood. Gold was pinned just below $2,000 an ounce.

Sundar Pichai

Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. 
On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter, and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. 
Today, I'll give an update on the 2 themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I'll talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube. 
First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. I've compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. 
In our last call, I outlined 3 areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. 
We have made good progress across all 3 areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful. And Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation. Lots more to come. 
For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. 
For years, we've been focused on making Search even more helpful. From Google Lens to multi-search, to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We'll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We'll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we'll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. 
As it evolves, we'll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. 
AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max use the full power of Google's AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. 
And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our Perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on, with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. 
We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. 
On to my second theme, the company's sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren't being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. 
Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We'll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. 
Next, Google Cloud. I'm pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. 
Over the past 3 years, GCP's annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. 
We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to 0 when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. 
Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features. 
In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. 
Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes-Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. 
We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe's Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. 
Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA's new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI. 
Turning next to YouTube. Let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter, with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. 
Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. 
On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto-download recommended videos for off-line viewing. 
And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators. 
To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI. We'll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products, including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. 
Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful is as urgent as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead. 
Over to you, Philipp.

Philipp Schindler

Thanks, Sundar, and hey, everyone. It's great to be here today. I'll kick off with Google Services' performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. 
Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. 
Now let's double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising: number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. 
First, Google AI. I've said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. 
Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. 
In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. 
In Creatives, we opened our Automatically Created Assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context and to the advertisers' business. 
To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers paired together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts. 
I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax, like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals. There's more to come here as we add even more AI product features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. 
Moving on to retail where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on 3 pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users; number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. 
In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use Target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.
For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. 
Danish department store, Magasin, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magasin can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. 
Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube's success. Across long form and shorts, music and podcasts, vertical and horizontal, YouTube is where Creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more viewers and more opportunities for advertisers. 
As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube's long-term growth. And to support this growth, we're focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. 
First, Shorts. We're seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. 
Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said, we're seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. 
Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we're helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they're looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and $19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube's ability to drive effectiveness at scale. 
Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of multiview on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are 2 examples of how we're investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. 
Number four, shopping on YouTube. It's still super early days. One highlight, last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We're excited about the potential ahead. 
I'll close with an awesome example of how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation, Mercedes-Benz. In February, we announced a first-of-its-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with its next-gen MB.OS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we'll also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. 
On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. 
Ruth, over to you.

Ruth M. Porat

Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. 
For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. 
In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by 3 factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. 
Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. 
Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. 
Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%, the biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. 
Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. 
We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
Turning to our segment results. These were affected by 2 additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, as of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. 
In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these 2 changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. 
Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between Search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. 
Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. 
Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment, and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. 
With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of Search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of Search was similar to last quarter. 
In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. 
In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. 
Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. 
Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to head count. 
I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. 
First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in 3 broad categories: number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As we've noted previously, all 3 work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years. 
Second, with respect to head count growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for head count for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent. 
In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind, with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. 
Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year. 
Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.

Brian Thomas Nowak

I have 2. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out? 
And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years?

Sundar Pichai

Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in Search, we have been using AI for a while. It's what has really helped lead Search and Search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think the main way -- and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We're going to -- our North Star is getting it right for users. So we'll iterate and innovate as we have always done. 
The main area maybe I'm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to Search. They follow on. They're engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it's a real opportunity. Obviously, if it's YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for Creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, et cetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it's an area where I think we'll see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. 
And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment to us, pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth?

Ruth M. Porat

And then in terms of the second part of your question, AI has been so much a part of what we've been doing for quite some time that there are a number of different ways to answer it. One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization. It's helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. 
And Sundar just noted what we're doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that's another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it's also something that's available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that we've talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we've done there and the infrastructure innovation which, again, is helpful internally for what we do but on behalf of our customers.

Operator

The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.

Douglas Till Anmuth

One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your Search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of Search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running Search on these models relative to today? 
And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow up on your comment on CapEx, maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago.

Sundar Pichai

Thanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to Search. But we'll be bringing LLM experiences more natively into Search as well. I do think, first of all, we'll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test, iterate and innovate. So I think we'll approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I'm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer and they are more creative, et cetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It's early days, but I think there's a lot of innovation to come. 
On the cost side, we have always -- cost of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it's something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it's a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it, because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we'll take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here, but I'm comfortable with how we'll approach it.

Ruth M. Porat

And in terms of CapEx, we do now expect that total CapEx for the year, for 2023, will be modestly higher than in 2022. And I tried to point out that we're expecting a step-up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. And as we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do. And we're continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers and our Cloud customers as we're commenting on here. And then as we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment and, on the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year.

Operator

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.

Eric James Sheridan

Maybe 2, if I could, first on cloud. Obviously, one of the dominant themes, and you touched upon it, is this client optimization theme that's going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and, possibly, the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? 
And then second on YouTube, obviously, you've seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization in Shorts compared to the consumption you've already seen in usage shifts?

Ruth M. Porat

So in terms of the cloud question, the point we're trying to underscore is there's uncertainty in the economic environment. And so we saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption, with customers really looking to optimize their cost given that macro climate. I'll leave the forecasting to you on that. But as both Sundar and I commented on, really pleased with the momentum that the team has been delivering and the breadth of what they've been working on.

Sundar Pichai

I do think, I would add, that we are leaning into optimization. I mean that's an important moment to help our customers, and we take a long-term view. And so it's definitely an area we are leaning in and trying to help customers make progress in their efficiencies where we can. Philipp?

Philipp Schindler

Yes, on the Shorts side, look, Shorts viewership is growing rapidly. We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We're pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. As I said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as is continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. 
Again, we're the only destination where Creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong creator adoption. So ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best places for Shorts viewers and Creators. And that's really what we're focused on right now.

Operator

The next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.

Ross Adam Sandler

I'll just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in a group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well. So how do you feel about Alphabet's ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft's ambitions to increase its share of paid search? And Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long term?

Sundar Pichai

Maybe I'll -- look, I think, these dynamics have always been around. It's important to remember. As far as I can remember, we've always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I can't comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. 
And when we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience. And ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that's what their users want. That's always been what's helped Search be widely distributed. So I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve Search and making sure we are leading there. So I think we've always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I'm comfortable that we'll continue to be able to do so.

Ruth M. Porat

And then in terms of just longer-term profitability, I think I'll broaden out your question somewhat because the way we're looking at it is we continue to be committed to investing for growth, and we want to ensure we have overall capacity for growth. And so we have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably reengineer our cost base. And in particular, what we're excited about are long-term opportunities with AI and we want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in Search and Ads, Cloud, YouTube, hardware. And so that underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility. 
And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we've discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory.

The next question will come from Justin Post of BAML.

Justin Post

Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think, on one hand, you'll see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion. But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition? Maybe give us your thoughts there.
And then, Ruth, backing out the onetime charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%, so real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think, in your optimization cycle?

Sundar Pichai

So first of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we've evolved Search, I think we've always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information. And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that's what drives this virtuous cycle. 
And I don't think the underpinnings over the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, et cetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we'll be able to drive innovation here like we've always done.

Ruth M. Porat

And in terms of our OpEx trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense and OpEx from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter, so a little bit of complexity there. 
But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we've talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we're doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we're doing around optimizing how and where we work. You've seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we're doing in, for example, office services, and we're executing against each of these various work streams. So our view is that there's more to do. And as we try to be clear, we're in execution mode. You'll see some of the benefit in '23, you'll see more of it in '24 and we're going to continue building against it beyond.

The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.

Michael Brian Nathanson

I have one for Philipp and one for Ruth. Philipp, we're trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this -- level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand? 
And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you're managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets? And what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets?

Ruth M. Porat

It was a bit hard to hear you. You were breaking up. So I think I'm going to start and address what I heard as to the second question, as we're looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, how does that affect the way we're looking at Other Bets. Hopefully, we heard you correctly. It was crackling. Look, I think as we've talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we're very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we're looking at the returns we can generate. 
Yes, absolutely mindful of the higher cost of capital, but I think, at its core, we're looking at what's the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets. And some of them, as they're on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we're looking at what's the overall return on invested capital. And we're continuing to work on these to make sure that we're delivering value. And your point is an important one, that's part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions.

Michael Brian Nathanson

Okay. Philipp, I don't know if you heard the first one.

Philipp Schindler

Yes. On the first part, again, it didn't come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance and media and entertainment. So excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search's resilience with the, I'd say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. 
I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals. I'd say, maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere. And across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pulled back ads budgets as well.

Operator

The next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore.

Mark Stephen F. Mahaney

Can I try 2 questions, please? I think, Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? 
And then Ruth, the Cloud business, even with the accounting changes, saw this very steady march towards profitability. You turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn't -- why they shouldn't be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale? Or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it's sustainably profitable, that segment cloud?

Ruth M. Porat

Yes, why don't I just -- I'll take both of those. So in network, really, it's a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and Network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. 
And then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think it's a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we're intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, and I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. So as I've said in the past, you shouldn't extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here.

Operator

And our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird.

Colin Alan Sebastian

Two for me as well. I guess, first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams, I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. So I'm curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that? 
And then Philipp, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front?

Sundar Pichai

Thanks. I'm quite excited by bringing the 2 world-class teams, I think, of both Brain and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment, and so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources, too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. 
The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it -- taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. So you already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we'll continue that progress, and we'll keep you posted as we do.

Philipp Schindler

So retail is an important vertical and driver for us, and I called out the year-over-year increase in retail and Search and other. I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we've established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it's online, off-line, both. We're helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop. Maybe a little more, some key trends here, retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. 
I've talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and off-line by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking. And new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards. And Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points. Overall, we're giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers, and this will continue to be our focus here.

86,2023-06-14T19:55:03+00:00,"AI: âGoogle is the adult in the room,â adviser says","Check Capital Management Managing Director Chris Ballard joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Alphabet earnings, investor sentiment, Googleâs search dominance, and the outlook for AI.

Video Transcript

- And turning to our top story now, getting into Google, Alphabet highlighting its cloud division in its earnings report, but investors considering if its cloud unit stands alone or if Google's worth more as the sum of its parts. Joining us now is a key investor, Chris Ballard, managing director at Check Capital Management, who holds the shares. Chris, thanks for being here.

So when we look at the different parts of Alphabet here, Search beating estimates but falling back a little bit, right? Cloud, it looks like for both Alphabet and Microsoft, doing a little bit better than estimated. What do you think is the most valuable part of Alphabet right now?

CHRIS BALLARD: Well, right now the Cloud business is fabulous. They did about 26%, 28% year-over-year versus the other quarter. And that's on the back of 44% growth last year for the same quarter. So they're really knocking it out of the park with the Cloud. And we expect that to continue going forward.

Search, obviously, is their big behemoth, right? About $40 billion of the revenue comes from Search, $40 billion of, let's say, the roughly $70 billion that they reported last quarter. So the fact that that's still growing and in a somewhat softening economy was a definite positive for us as well.

- We've talked a little bit about YouTube here this morning as well and how that business is doing. It looks like it is seeing a little bit of improvement there. Do you think that is one of the secret weapons, if you will, over the longer term for Alphabet?

CHRIS BALLARD: Oh, absolutely. So yeah, Alphabet bought YouTube in about 2006 for roughly $1.7 billion. They did over $7 billion of revenue last quarter. We think they're going to continue to grow quite rapidly as time goes on.

The year-over-year comparisons are a little bit difficult right now because when everybody was staying at home and constantly looking at their phones and doing things on their phones, the pandemic really pulled forward a lot of numbers related to the likes of YouTube. So it slowed a little bit last quarter. And also they're starting to emphasize a little bit of these YouTube Shorts to compete against TikTok and that sort of thing.

Story continues

But we think that over time, Alphabet's going to continue to approach this the right way. And we very much see YouTube as a valuable asset. I think it's about 25% of all internet searches these days actually are run through YouTube.

- Chris, a lot of the discussion lately around Alphabet has been around AI, right, and the seeming market perception that Microsoft is out ahead on this issue and could even start to chip away at Google's search dominance. As an investor in Alphabet, how concerned are you about that issue?

CHRIS BALLARD: Yeah, so Google has a huge moat, right? And so the notion that their 97% or 98% search share could get chipped into 0.08% month-over-month when ChatGPT was introduced, it has a lot of people fearful. And Google's price fell off something like $80 billion in value when ChatGPT was first launched. And Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, basically told Google, let's dance.

We really think that Google is the adult in the room on this. They've been very conservative with how they want to approach their artificial intelligence. For the last couple of few years, they've had the ability to roll out their own artificial intelligence. And they decided not to in the way that Microsoft or, let's say, OpenAI and ChatGPT is.

There's a lot of indications at this point in time that-- there's hallucinations, for instance, that happen with artificial intelligence if you ask it for more than a few questions in a row. And so there's a lot of call for that to be pulled back and slowed down. So, at the end of the day, we think that Alphabet has a long-term great position in this space. And they will do very well over the long haul.

They're just choosing to be more conservative, where others right now are choosing to go ahead and introduce artificial intelligence. And it's a big talking point. It's really fun to talk about right now. But we definitely think they're going to be a leader in this space. And it's going to be here to stay, for sure.

- Well, and there's also how much these various companies are spending on it. And with that, I want to turn to expenses at Alphabet, which, of course, like many of its large-cap tech peers, has been cutting back on expenses, has been cutting people. Where are we in that process? Do you think that we're going to see more layoffs, for example, at Alphabet before the year is done?

CHRIS BALLARD: Sure. Yeah, no, expenses have been very high at Alphabet, too high, in our opinion. We think that they should be making some great changes. I think this time last year, there was a period in time where they had done a hiring spree, where they had about 20% more employees year-over-year.

They slowed down on that hiring spree. And, obviously, as you know, they started laying off some folks. They laid off about 6% of their workforce relatively recently.

So with regard to that, there's going to be some tailwinds going forward, where they have some one-time expenses that are showing up on their earnings, where they would be-- their earnings, for instance, was down year-over-year about 5%, where their revenues were up. But if you were to take out some of these one-time expenses, their earnings would have been up about 10% or so year-over-year.

But they're going to continue to spend on CapEx and research and development. It's a very important aspect of what they do. We want them to do that. They have a tremendous amount of free cash flow coming to them and $133 billion in the bank.

So they're taking all that cash flow. And they're buying more shares of stock. And we think they're doing basically the right thing at this point.

But we weren't happy with how some of the expenses were going in the past. But they will continue to have quite the runway of expenses. I think they had about $11 billion in expenses this past quarter on research and development.

- And just to put a fine point on one thing you said, especially since we're going to be having a buyback discussion in just a minute, so you're happy that they are deploying capital to buy back their own shares?

CHRIS BALLARD: We are. Yes. We are very happy that they are. We think it's a very good thing. It needs to be done in a responsible manner. And they're doing it in a very responsible manner.

So they accelerated their buybacks last year when their stock price came down. And that's a very important aspect of buybacks. You want to buy when prices are low. And as a long-term shareholder, right, they're buying back at a rate of about-- they'll but back about 5% of their outstanding shares over the course of a year. And so without doing anything, we've become 5% more of an owner in their business.

But yeah, they bought back about $14 to $15 billion over the last couple of quarters. With their newest announcement of $70 billion of buybacks in the coming year being authorized, we think that pace will continue. And as long as they continue to do it when the price is down, like it is right now, we think it's the right thing to do for long-term shareholders.

- Chris, thanks for your perspective. Chris Ballard, managing director at Check Capital Management and an Alphabet shareholder. Thanks you.

CHRIS BALLARD: Thanks for having me, Julie.

- Thanks."

Net revenues, excluding total traffic acquisition costs or TAC (the portion of revenues shared with Googleâs partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website), were $58.1 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark of $57.2 billion. The figure rose 3.7% from the year-ago quarterâs level.

TAC of $11.7 billion was down 2.2% year over year.

Top-line growth was driven by the solid momentum in GOOGLâs cloud business and improvements in Search performance.

Alphabet witnessed sluggishness in YouTube ads and Google Network ads due to a slowdown in digital advertisement spending. This remained a major concern. Also, softness in the Other Bets segment was a downside.

Alphabetâs growing investments in AI, strong efforts to boost Search business and expanding cloud services portfolio, which is expected to yield huge returns in the days ahead, remain major positives. This, in turn, is expected to instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.

The company has announced a massive $70 billion share repurchase plan. This remains a major positive.

Alphabet has gained 22.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industryâs growth of 19.3%.

89,2023-06-14T17:40:42+00:00,12 Cheap Internet Stocks to Buy Now,"In this piece, we will take a look at 12 cheap internet stocks to buy now. For more internet stocks, head on over to 5 Cheap Internet Stocks to Buy Now.

The world that we live in today is vastly different from the one just a couple of decades ago. Want a ride? Use your smartphone. Want to order food? Again, you're smartphone is right there. Bored and want to watch Netflix? Guess what gadget will help you once again. However, the smartphone would not have half the functionality that it has today were it not for the Internet. The project, initially started by the U.S. military, is now a global reality and its impacts are so profound that even the United Nations has adopted a non binding resolution that believes internet access is a human right. This definition builds on the human right to free speech and access to resolution, but the resolution was opposed by some countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and China.

At the same time, the Internet has also given us multi billion dollar companies that rely on it as a primary component of their business model. The biggest example of this is the rise of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is one of the world's biggest electronic commerce retailers and whose latest market capitalization sits at a stunning $996 billion. Another mega company that owes its existence to everybody's favorite communications and entertainment medium, is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Finally, any mention of Internet companies is incomplete without Google, whose parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the largest on our brief set of examples through an absolutely massive market capitalization of $1.2 trillion.

But how big, or what really is the 'internet industry'? This is a tough question that is bound to leave you scratching your head, because after all, if it weren't for the Internet, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) wouldn't exist either. So does this primary reliance on the Internet make Uber an internet company? Or is it simply a transportation services provider, and telecommunications firms such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) which actually do provide everyday users with Internet coverage are the true internet companies? We think it's both of them, and it's an important distinction to make as you'll find you below.

Story continues

The distinction is important because it lets us place a value on the true worth of firms in this elusive internet industry since it has several sub segments with massive valuations of their own. For instance, consider the video on demand industry that's dominated by Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). According to a research report from Fortune Business Insights, this industry was worth $69.5 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.6% until 2029 to sit at an estimated $257 billion by the end of the forecast period. Another estimate, this time for the transportation as a service (TaaS) industry which consists primarily of firms like Uber, suggests that this sector presents an unbelievable market opportunity of $8 trillion courtesy of its different constituent divisions such as micro mobility. Yet, while the TaaS sector presents an $8 trillion opportunity, the global electronic commerce industry has already crossed the lucrative trillion dollar valuation, with one research report outlining that this industry was worth $2.6 trillion in 2021, will have grown to $3 trillion in 2022, and from then until 2026 will demonstrate a CAGR of 12% for a final value of $4.79 trillion.

Finally, even though it has shaken up human existence, the Internet still has more in store for us. This is courtesy of both 5G telecommunications (for 5G stocks, take a look at 13 Best 5G Stocks to Buy) and satellite coverage (for more on space, head on over to 11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In) - both of which have started to pick up the pace only recently and are projected to have a massive valuation. For instance, the global satellite internet market is estimated to grow at a stunning 20.4% CAGR between 2021 and 2030 and have a final value of $18.5 billion according to Allied Market Research, and according to estimates from the investment bank Morgan Stanley, the sector will represent at least 50% of the total growth in the global space economy by 2040. For reference, the bank believes that the space sector can cross $1 trillion by that time.

As for 5G, here's what Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)'s chief executive officer Mr. Hans Vestberg had to say during the firm's latest analyst call:

Our engineers have the best track record for designing and building networks that produce the best experience. Our network will continue to evolve with a relentless commitment to quality and reliability, adding capacity where needed and filling service gaps where they exist even as capital intensity declines in the coming years. In the shift to 5G, we have been rapidly building out our C-band spectrum with the most aggressive deployment plan in our companyâs history. We are tracking to 200 million POPs this quarter and are well ahead of schedule to reach our 250 million POP targeted by year-end 2024. C-band propagation is very similar to that of AWS and PCS spectrum, which covers more than 300 million POPs today. This gives us a clear path to scale C-band quickly and efficiently, including in the 330 markets where we expect to gain complete access to the C-band spectrum later this year.

The Google parent's results were a far cry from the rapid growth the company has historically reported, but investors had dialed down their expectations since the digital ad market has weakened due to the slowdown in the macro economy. Overall, Alphabet's revenue grew 3%, or 6% on a constant currency basis, to $69.8 billion, topping the consensus at $68.9 billion, while earnings per share fell from $1.23 to $1.17, though that topped estimates at $1.07.

There are fresh fears about the state of the banking system as First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) shares continue to come under extreme pressure. They were down another 29% on Wednesday and are now down 95% for the year despite a show of support in March from a group of large banks, which injected $30 billion of deposits.

The worries are overshadowing strong earnings reports from Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which are racing each other and competitors to grab share in artificial intelligence applications. Microsoft's shares rose on Wednesday even though U.K. competition regulators blocked its proposed deal for game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI).

More earnings are set to pour out the remainder of this week and next week, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on deck in the coming days.

Until then, investors are awaiting a first-quarter read of gross domestic product and personal consumption expenditure data on Friday, a key inflation report the Federal Reserve closely monitors.

The Fed heads into its next policy meeting in May with expectations it will raise the benchmark rate another quarter of a percentage point.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Amazon earnings

E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenue of $124.5B, but analysts will be listening to what it says about its web services, cloud computing division and streaming customers.

2. Mastercard reports

Card company Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.71 on revenue of $5.64B, and analysts will be waiting to hear what it says about consumer credit quality and spending trends.

3. Drug earnings

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.69 on revenue of $6.84B, while Merck&Company Inc (NYSE:MRK) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.35 on revenue of $13.8B.

94,2023-06-14T16:19:46+00:00,Stock market today: Dow falls as banking jitters overshadow Microsoft rally,"Investing.com -- The Dow fell Wednesday, as fresh banking turmoil weighed on sentiment despite a Microsoft-fueled jump in tech following better-than-expected quarterly results.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, or 228 points lower, the S&P 500 fell 0.4%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.4%.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rallied 7% after reporting quarterly reported third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates as its Azure cloud business held up better than expected at a time when many were worried about the impact from a slowdown in enterprise spending.

âThe star of the report and the focus of the Street was Azure revenue growth of 31%,"" Wedbush says, adding that the tech giantâs guidance for Q4 was âsolid and much better than feared.â

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), meanwhile, also delivered better-than-expected quarterly results as its core Google search business performed better than feared, but concerns about the tech giantâs plan to boost spending and hiring weighed.

The positive results from Alphabet provided a positive look through to Meta's results due after the market close on Wednesday.

âWe see potential upside to our modestly above-consensus $27.8B 1Q23 revenue given the historical relationship between YouTube and Meta sequential ad revenue growth,â UBS said in a note.

Beyond tech, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) ended the day slightly above the flatline as the aircraft maker delivered better-than-expected quarterly revenue and detailed plans to ramp up production of its 737 jets.

Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), meanwhile, jumped 13% to a record high as investors cheered the Mexican fast food chain's better-than-expected quarterly results that were bolstered by price hikes.

In financials, First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) renewed banking crisis fears on reports that the U.S. regulators are mulling whether to downgrade their private assessment of First Republic in a move that would restrict the lender's access to the Fed's lending facility, Bloomberg reported.

Story continues

PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) shrugged off the doom in regional banks to rise 7% after announcing that the pace of deposit outflows seen in the first quarter had stabilized. The regional bank also reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates on Tuesday.

Energy fell nearly 1% as oil prices continued to slip as ongoing fears about a recession overshadowed data showing a much larger than expected drop in weekly U.S. crude inventories.

In deal news, Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) plunged nearly 12% as its $69B takeover by Microsoft was thrown into further doubt after a UK regulator blocked the deal amid antitrust concerns.

97,2023-06-14T15:47:34+00:00,Microsoft 'holding a lot of the cards' in AI-powered search war with Google,"Microsoft (MSFT) stock surged on Wednesday after a strong quarterly report highlighted the companyâs artificial intelligence advancements and its perceived lead against rival Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent company of Google.

After beating Google to the AI punch with a ChatGPT integration and $10 billion investment into OpenAI, Microsoft is now waging war on Googleâs long-owned turf: Search.

âWe look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search,â Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said on the companyâs earnings call Tuesday night.

Microsoft flaunted 10% revenue growth in search, citing share gains for Bing and its Edge browser (a direct competitor to Google Chrome). Bing now has more than 100 million daily active users while daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown four times since the launch of the AI powered version of the product two months ago.

On the other hand, Google called its search revenue âresilient.â The long-time search leader saw 2% growth in the category.

âIt is a generational paradigm shift,"" Ted Mortonson, Baird technology strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I would say Microsoft is holding a lot of the cards right now.â

Microsoft shares rose as much as 8.5% in intraday trading while Alphabet shares ticked slightly above the flat line in midday trading.

A year ago, Microsoft didnât mention Bing once on its earnings call. The search engine hasnât been a growth driver for Microsoft in the past, at least not at the level that search drives the narrative for Alphabet, where âGoogle Search and otherâ accounts for more than half of the companyâs revenue.

Google, for its part, defended itâs long-standing search dominance throughout its call on Tuesday night, with CEO Sundar Pichai noting, âObviously, in search, we have been using AI for a while.â

Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who has a Sell rating on Microsoft, points out Bingâs growth as noteworthy. Bingâs growth in the quarter reversed a five-quarter downward trend, according to DiFucci.

Story continues

âAnother line weâve not focused on in the past, but probably should going forward is Bing,â DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. âWeâd assume that if Microsoft can be an outsized beneficiary of generative AI (Chat GPT), it would show up in this line.â

Among other catalysts, Microsoft's position in AI pushed DiFucci's price target on Microsoft up to $232 from $212. The logo of Microsoft is seen on the exterior of their offices in Herzliya, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 27, 2022. REUTERS/Rami Amichay

While ChatGPT has been seen as the consumer-facing leader in the AI arms race, Microsoft believes its ability to tie the new technology to its Azure platform could be crucial as well.

Microsoft now has 10 times more Azure OpenAI service customers than last quarter, with more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI service customers, per the companyâs earnings call. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% in the third quarter compared to the same period a year prior. Citi estimates that AI could amount to one point of Azureâs growth in the next quarter.

âAzure took share as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered,â Nadella said on the call. âWe have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it is being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA and leading AI start-ups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.â

So while âGooglingâ remains a verb, the environment in search is changing. Google's tease of its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, flopped. Gen Z is using TikTok for search, ChatGPT is the fastest growing app in history and Microsoft wants in on search now more than ever.

â(Microsoft) is almost kind of like the technology Death Star if you will,â Mortonson said. âMicrosoft has incredible management that executes. In that respect, as you move into generative AI, they've been working with OpenAI for years and have a huge investment. Itâs powered by Nvidia and sits on Azure. Thatâs a pretty big initial advantage in this next war.""

""This Is Probably The First Year Of What Could Be A 5 Or 10 Year Investment Cycle""

On April 19 BofA Securities' senior semiconductor analyst, Vivek Arya, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about the semiconductor space and how advancements in artificial intelligence have the potential to play a key role in driving its growth. Arya noted that the adoption of AI applications is still in an early stage and 2023 ""is probably the first year of what could be a 5 or 10 year investment cycle"". Arya noted that managing AI workloads requires high levels of computational power and resources.Â He talked about how NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now competing with cloud services providers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) for chip market share.

Vivek Arya noted that though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is at the forefront of the AI chip trade, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also have their own AI chips, Inferentia and TPU respectively.

Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS Inferentia offers native support for PyTorch and Tensorflow, two of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for building production systems. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), an AI accelerator for deep learning applications.Â Moreover, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also developing its own AI chip. On April 18, Reuters reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been working on its AI chip since 2019 and it is now in a testing phase.

Vivek Arya talked about chip pricing and how the increasing adoption of AI by cloud services providers is calling for more high performance semiconductors. He said that though NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) new chips are up to 3 times more expensive than the company's previous generation products, they are also offering higher performance and increased energy efficiency. Arya further spoke about the success of ChatGPT and how it has ""created this cycle of adoption that is just kicking off"". Here is what Vivek Arya said:

Story continues

""It's not just the top threeÂ or four hyperscalers, you know, rememberÂ each of them used to be a startup at oneÂ point and they displaced the incumbent. And now what we have in the valley isÂ three or four hundred startup companiesÂ that are trying to develop new and innovative applications with this newÂ technology. So when they do that they need compute power that isÂ available on the cloud and that is whereÂ the need for GPUs, we think, can grow evenÂ faster than what we had anticipated last year.""

As AI adoption increases, the need for more sophisticated and powerful semiconductors is expected to grow. Moreover, as cloud services providers start making in-house chips for high performance computing applications, the semiconductor equipment industry is poised to exhibit strong growth. Some of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now includeÂ ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML),Â Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), andÂ Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below. 10 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy

Alphabet's stock rose slightly during after-hours trading following that report, but it remains nearly 30% below its all-time high from November 2021. Alphabet generated 79% of its revenue from Google's advertising platforms (including its search engine and YouTube) in the first quarter.

103,2023-06-14T14:21:57+00:00,Amazon Earning Preview: Buy AMZN Stock Despite Slowing Cloud Growth?,"E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon AMZN reports earnings Thursday, April 27 after the market close. The precarious nature of the current market regime makes this report quite significant.

Of particular interest to investors will be revenue numbers in AWS Cloud, as it has been a major driver of growth for Amazon. Its primary competitors in the cloud space, Microsoft MSFT, and Alphabet GOOGL reported earnings Tuesday evening, and provided interesting insights into what to expect from AMZN.

Amazon has been on a tear, rallying 25% YTD, considerably better performance than the S&P 500. However, investors shouldnât forget how painful 2022 was for AMZN. The stock price more than halved in 2022, leaving Amazon shares still down almost -40% over the last two years, well below the performance of the index. Zacks Investment Research

Technical Setup

Amazon stock traded down to an area of strong buying interest over the last few months. After testing, and then trading below the pre-covid highs, AMZN stock price dove all the way down to the Covid-lows. But after testing the Covid-lows, buyers stepped in massively, pushing price back to the top of the range.

If Amazon can retake the pre-Covid highs ~$110 level, it should be an extremely bullish signal for the stock. Additionally, the $100 level seems to be a psychological level of interest, and I think so long ass price holds above there, investors can remain bullish. TradingView

Earnings Expectations

Considering the forecasted weakness in business and consumer spending broadly, analysts still have fairly strong expectations for Amazon. Sales are projected to grow 7.2% YoY to $125 billion for the current quarter. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

But analyst estimates have been falling over the last two months. Earnings for the current quarter have been revised lower by -12.5%, and because of the amount of downgrades Amazon currently exhibits a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating mixed earnings revisions.

Story continues

Nonetheless, the Zacks Earnings ESP expects Amazon to beat estimates by 11.5%. Last quarter Amazon really blew away analyst expectations and reported earnings that were 40% above estimates. Zacks Investment Research

Cloud Computing

In the Q4 report, Amazonâs cloud computing segment reported 20% growth YoY, below Q3âs 28% growth, and Q2 33% growth. While 20% growth in sales is nothing to scoff at, the deceleration is an extremely important development, as AWS is a major engine for growth. Because of the shifting macroeconomic environment, firms have clearly tried to cut some of their cloud spending.

Microsoft reported better than expected earnings on Tuesday, beating both sales and earnings expectations. But Microsoft posted a considerable deceleration in its cloud services sales as well. Cloud services reported a 27% YoY growth in sales which has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022. Additionally, while MSFT did beat estimates, they were very moderate expectations, barely projecting growth.

Alphabet too had very soft earnings expectations which they beat handily. GOOGL also followed the same trend as MSFT regarding slowing growth. Google cloud services grew 28% YoY, which again is a very impressive number, but still a quarter over quarter decline. Additionally, Alphabet reported its first profitable quarter in cloud services, which is a strong development.

These slowdowns are certainly not ringing any alarm bells â yet. Cloud is a maturing business, and at some point, growth was going to slow down. But investors should stay focused on Amazonâs cloud services growth numbers. AWS is the leading provider of cloud services so an unexpected slowdown may shake things up.

Valuation

Amazon is currently trading at a one-year forward price to sales ratio of 1.9x, which is well below its 10-year median of 2.7x and below the broad market average of 3.6x. This is a compelling valuation for the tech giant. Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

It is critical for investors to watch for the cloud services growth numbers from Amazon on Thursdayâs earnings call. As the biggest player in the industry, owning 34% market share (MSFT is 2nd with 21%), its results are a bellwether for the sector more broadly.

Also important will be the e-commerce and retail results. Because Amazon is such a massive player in the retail industry its business results provide valuable insight into the spending habits of consumers.

105,2023-06-14T14:00:00+00:00,"YouTube Staff Vote for Union, Paving Way for Collective Bargaining With Alphabet","(Bloomberg) -- The majority of a group of YouTube contract staff in Texas have voted to unionize in a labor victory that could force parent company Alphabet Inc. to collectively bargain with US workers for the first time in its history.

Ballots are being counted by the US National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday.

The workers, whose jobs include ensuring videos are correctly labeled and handling requests from users of YouTube Music, are hired via the staffing agency Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. But those who petitioned in October to unionize contend that they are also employees of Google, which runs YouTube. In a March ruling, a regional director of the NLRB agreed, deeming Google a âjoint employerâ â a company that has enough control of a group of workers to be liable for their treatment and obligated to negotiate with them if they unionize.

Alphabet, Googleâs parent company, is appealing the March ruling and has repeatedly denied that it employs the sub-contracted staff. âThese have not been and are not our employees,â company attorney Aaron Agenbroad said at a November labor board hearing, according to a transcript obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. Cognizant has said it also disagrees with the NLRB.

The NLRB could formally certify the union as soon as next week. Were that to happen, Alphabet would legally be required to collectively bargain with the Alphabet Workers Union, the Communications Workers of America affiliate the staffers voted to join. That watershed change would restrict the tech giantâs authority over how it sets working conditions that affect those workers, and could embolden workers in other parts of the company to seek similar status.

Story continues

It could be years before talks actually commence. Even if labor board members in Washington, where Democrats hold a majority, uphold the regional directorâs decision, Alphabet could still refuse to negotiate, ultimately forcing the issue into federal appeals court. Starbucks Corp. is asking appellate judges to overturn the labor boardâs ruling that it must negotiate with employees at a megacafe in Seattle, where it objects to the use of mail ballots. Amazon.com Inc. has signaled it expects to contest a New York City warehouseâs union victory in US court as well.

The treatment of contract workers has been a recurring flashpoint for Alphabet, which relies heavily on staffing firms. Contract staff became the majority of the companyâs global workforce in 2018, and AWU has been pushing to organize both those workers and Alphabetâs direct employees. Several groups of Alphabet contract staff have unionized and won collective bargaining with their staffing agencies, but because Alphabet was not deemed a joint employer in those cases, the internet giant itself has not had to negotiate with them.

AWU has also filed a still-pending complaint with the NLRB accusing Alphabet and Cognizant of responding to the union campaign by making threats, transferring work abroad and using new return-to-office rules to try to derail organizing. Cognizant has said the allegations have âno merit.â Workers have been on strike for months over that dispute.

106,2023-06-14T13:49:52+00:00,"Microsoft, Alphabet ramp up spending on AI as competition heats up","Yahoo Finance Live discusses the competition between Microsoft and Alphabet as the two companies ramp up their spending on AI development of search engine products.

Video Transcript

- All right, I got my eyes on another stock that's up today, Microsoft and also Alphabet. Specifically, the difference that we're looking at here between Microsoft and Alphabet, you can see Microsoft taking a big jump higher today, up about just over 7% now. And Alphabet still barely over the flat line. And something I've been looking at today, is the emphasis in Search that we saw from those calls yesterday.

So on one hand, you have Microsoft and Satya Nadella sort of championing Search and their role that AI is playing in Search. They saw 10% growth in Search. And then, you have Alphabet and Sundar Pichai basically defending their stance in Search, at one point calling growth resilient. They saw 2% growth.

Now obviously, when we think about Alphabet, when we think about Google, Search is still a major part of their business obviously, over half of their revenue.

- Still over--

- And they're dominant in that space. But you're seeing what Microsoft wants to do with AI. So they came first to market, which actually BT, right? And they came with that product. Now, they want to bring that turf war to Search, to Google's baby. And they're really sort of attacking them in certain ways in this call. And I thought that was interesting.

You heard them mention Bing several times yesterday. They said that Bing downloads have now 4X-ed over the last two months. And that mobile app, they didn't even mention Bing last year on that earnings call. So, a clear shift from Microsoft to say, hey, we want to talk about Bing, and we want to talk about Search. Because we're going to be a player here. And they're trying to come for Google in some ways.

- It's interesting to hear 100 million daily active users for Bing. We don't have a frame of reference for that.

- Sure.

- So, it would be really nice to know if that's up from 20 million or 90 million. But now, we do have a marker. So next quarter, I hope that question is asked, how many daily active users, so we can measure the growth there. But Bing, 100 million daily active users versus a billion for Google, just for a little frame of reference.

Story continues

I did enjoy this quote from an executive, who said for every one point of share gain in the Search advertising market, it's a $2 billion revenue opportunity. So that gives you a sense that every little bit they gain on Google, massive revenue opportunity.

- It's a massive revenue opportunity. I was listening to the earnings call last night from Microsoft, and Satya Nadella was clearly on the offensive. He was very excited about the numbers that they were putting out. They were hyping their involvement, what they have done in AI a number of times throughout the call. Almost every single analyst question was regarding AI, with the exception of some that were asking about, is your cloud obviously very important to Microsoft right now?

But a lot of the focus was on AI. And another thing that Satya did add here, in terms of Bing, they said that the feedback that they're getting from the users that have adopted it so far has been very positive. So, they're encouraged by what they're hearing. I think it's a massive opportunity for Microsoft, and it's a big reason why the stock is up just about 20% year to date.

- OK, we got our burrito orders. Have you ever used Bing?

- I still haven't.

- I have.

- Neither have I.

- But I don't use it.

- And?

- It's fine.

- Fine.

- But I still go to Chrome.

- I've never even considered using it, yeah.

- Google.

- Still a verb, Google. All right."

110,2023-06-14T12:33:54+00:00,Microsoft and Alphabet Earnings: Battle for Search Supremacy Begins,"Both Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL posted positive earnings reports Tuesday, beating analystsâ estimates. Admittedly, analysts had rather tepid expectations for the tech giants as GOOGL beat with just 3% YoY growth in sales, and MSFT with 7% YoY sales growth, its first single digit percent gain in years.

Both stocks have been performing extremely well with GOOGL +17% YTD and Microsoft +24%. These strong performances come off the back of a very challenging 2022 where MSFT was down nearly -40% off its all-time high and GOOGL was down -45%. Nonetheless, as two of the premier companies in the world, both have outperformed the market considerably over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research

Microsoft Earnings

Sales of $53 billion for the quarter was the highest reported quarter in the companyâs history and beat analystsâ expectations of $51 billion. Microsoft has increased their revenues by a CAGR of 13% over the last 10 years, an enviable rate for one of the world's largest companies. Zacks Investment Research

Microsoft was very quick to highlight its exciting new AI developments and say that they aim âto create a new era of computing.â According to MSFT management, demand for AI products is very strong, and they are pleased with the engagement.

They also noted that AI will create a huge opportunity for its Microsoft Bing search engine, which already has the newest version of GPT (the language model from partner OpenAI) integrated into it. Google investors have been watching these developments closely.

While most segments of MSFT business saw steady growth, two segments were down bad. Devices continue to lag severely, showing a -30% drop in sales growth YoY. Windows OEM, formerly Microsoftâs bread and butter, also saw a YoY decline in sales of -28%.

Cloud services and Azure led the top line with 22% and 27% YoY sales growth respectively. As impressive as those numbers are, cloud sales are clearly decelerating. Azure sales in the prior quarter showed YoY growth of 31%.

Story continues

Alphabet Earnings

Alphabet was projecting a YoY decline in sales growth going into the report but was able to eek out a small gain. At $76 billion in revenue for the quarter, GOOGL posted its largest quarter in the companyâs history. However, the once unstoppable growth machine has experienced a multi-quarter bout of single digit and negative sales growth.

Management also announced a massive $70 billion buyback plan. GOOGL has made a concerted effort to reduce share count since 2019 and has cut the number shares outstanding by 7% since then. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Ad revenue broadly, and Ad revenue from YouTube beat expectation, but were unable to surpass number from a year ago. In an effort to address the weakness in advertising revenue, Alphabet has cut costs and scaled back significantly. GOOGL laid off some 12,000 employees over the last year, reducing its headcount by ~6%.

Google Cloud provided some exciting news, noting that it was the first quarter on record where the segment posted positive net earnings. Revenue from the Cloud segment showed 27% YoY growth, which as impressive as it is shows a slowdown in cloud sales growth.

It was an overall okay quarter for the search engine giant. Managing to show revenue growth and profitability in the cloud was a necessity. It will be very interesting to see how Alphabet fares if the economy continues to weaken.

Search and AI

First things first, Google is still the unequivocal king when it comes to search engine usage. At 94% of total market share Google absolutely dominates all competitors. But that doesn't mean Microsoftâs new and improved Bing search engine canât start chipping away at that lead. Oberlo

Image Source: Oberlo

Googleâs Bard, their response to AI enabled Bing has experienced a lot of criticism. With the first iteration being written off as ""worse than useless.â

In another scary moment for Alphabet, Samsung announced that it may dump Google search for Bing. While that is certainly a major threat, default search on devices is more about money than quality. Alphabet pays Samsung a reported $3.5 billion a year and Apple $20 billion to be the default search engine on the products.

This may just be an attempt by Samsung to bargain with Alphabet, but GOOGL is taking these threats seriously. Management at GOOGL have now merged its two separate AI teams and spent $3.3 billion in the quarter on AI developments.

YouTube Shorts, the company's short-form video service, is catching on with users, advertisers, and creators, company executives said during YouTube and Google-parent company Alphabet's quarterly earnings conference call this week.

Shorts is the ânumber oneâ area of focus for âYouTubeâs long-term growth,"" Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said during the call, pointing to the service's rising status in the âcreator ecosystemâ and YouTube's own âmulti-format strategy.â

""People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates,"" Schindler said, citing growth in ""watchtime"" as well as monetization of the short video clips.

And creators are increasingly cottoning to Shorts: According to YouTube, the number of channels uploading daily to Shorts grew by 80% in the first quarter of 2023 versus the final three months of 2022. And Google has expanded the number of ways for marketers to put their ads in Shorts, the company said.

The momentum for YouTube Shorts comes as new YouTube CEO Neal Mohan took the company reins in March after Susan Wojickiâs nine-year tenure in its top spot. In his short time at the top of the video giant, Mohan has made Shorts an enormous priority, positioning the product as the future for creator growth, communities and content diversification.

YouTube's primacy as the dominant hub for online videos has been challenged recently by TikTok, the popular video sharing app, and YouTube's ad revenue has declined for the last three consecutive quarters. With Shorts, YouTube is trying to blunt TikTok's momentum by giving consumers and creators its own short-video offering.

Shorter videos means less space for ads, though. But Schindler said Tuesday that YouTube to ""closing the gap"" between the ad revenue it has traditionally racked up from longer videos on and the revenue it earns from shorter clips. Indeed, YouTube's $6.7 billion in Q1 ad revenue was down 2.6% from the year-ago period, a less brutal decline than the 7.8% drop it suffered in Q4.

Company executives on Alphabet's earnings call repeatedly stressed Shortsâ growing audiences, payouts to creators and content (mobile-optimized and maximum 60 seconds long) as the roadmap to wide-ranging corporate success for the parent company.Â Daily Shorts views have increased from 30 billion last spring to 50 billion today.

Alphabet's reports of increased engagement and payouts also represent a bright spot in an unsteady financial landscape for creators. In recent weeks Meta terminated its somewhat baffling Reels Bonus payouts. Meanwhile, Snapchat has opened its lucrative advertising revenue share program to qualifying creators, while TikTok has launched a number of initiatives to pay creators, but none seem to have meaningfully padded creatorsâ bank accounts.

Many creators echo Alphabetâs optimism view about Shorts, noting that YouTube pays significantly better than the other platforms. âYouTube was the last big platform to the [short-form video] game, but itâs the one dominating right now because of the way itâs set up monetizations,â Peet Montzingo, who has 11.7 million YouTube subscribers and says he makes between $20,000 to $50,000 per month on AdSense payouts from the platform, tells Fortune. âIt's a great incentive for people like me to keep posting.â

Still, Montzingo is at the higher end of the industry. Less prominent creators note that while the pay from YouTube Shorts is much better than that of Instagram or TikTok, it still doesnât generate âenough revenue for a liveable wage.â

Those are the words of Sarah Funk, who has nearly 210,000 subscribers on YouTube and taps 12 other income streams to make ends meet as a full-time creator. Still, she notes that YouTube Shorts pays far better than any other platform. âLiving in New York City, YouTube Shorts will not generate enough revenue for a livable wage, but it pays better than TikTok and Instagram,â she says. âItâs the best option right now for creators that want to make short-form content.â

The four Shorts creators whom Fortune interviewed for this story noted their pay rates on ad revenue (known as RPM or rate per million) have increased in recent weeks. This is occurring relatively soon after the platform launched Shorts monetization, which âexcitedâ creators, and even prompted the Pink Shirt Couple--with their 11 million YouTube subscribers--to take a hiatus from sponsorships and focus exclusively on YouTube and YouTube Shorts.

113,2023-06-14T11:54:34+00:00,"Meta earnings, U.S. growth data, debt ceiling bill passed - what's moving markets","Investing.com -- Investors are awaiting U.S. economic growth data, all while digesting results from Facebook owner Meta and looking ahead to Amazon's latest earnings. Elsewhere, House Republicans pass a new debt ceiling bill, but the political wrangling in Washington over the issue looks to be far from finished.

1. Growth data on the horizon

U.S. stocks are seen opening higher on Thursday, as investors await the release of key economic data and gauge renewed concerns over the health of the country's banking sector.

By 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 78 points or 0.23%, S&P 500 futures traded 20 points or 0.49% higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 105 points or 0.81%.

Growth in the U.S. is projected to have slowed to 2.0% annually in the first quarter, according to Reuters projections, down from 2.6% in the prior three-month period. Economists anticipate that relative weakness in inventories and exports will be countered by an uptick in consumption in the world's biggest economy.

The Federal Reserve's recent aggressive string of interest rate hikes is also expected to show signs of weighing on broader activity. Over the past year, the U.S. central bank has lifted borrowing costs at an unprecedented clip in an attempt to cool red-hot inflation.

Next week, the Fed is widely tipped to increase rates by another 25 basis points, which would bring the federal funds target to a range of 5% to 5.25%. However, officials may be mulling over a pause in the tightening cycle to give themselves time to examine the impact of last month's turmoil in the financial services sector.

A sharp dip in shares of regional lender First Republic has stoked fresh worries that the banking tumult may only be in remission, and not yet completely eradicated. First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), which reported $100 billion in customer withdrawals in March, saw its stock tumble by 29.75% on Wednesday, extending a series of sharp declines throughout this week.

2. Meta Reels in ad sales

Growth in advertising sales has returned to Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) for the first time in almost a year, which chief executive Mark Zuckerberg credited to solid performance of Reels, the tech giant's answer to the craze for TikTok-like short-form videos.

Ad revenue moved higher by 4.1% in the January to March period to $28.10B, topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of $26.76B. The total top-line figure in Meta's second quarter increased by 2.6% year-on-year to $28.65B, also beating expectations.

In a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Reels was helping drive overall app engagement, adding that the company believes it is gaining share in the short-form video market.

Shares in Meta, which also delivered a higher-than-anticipated second quarter revenue forecast of $29.5B to $32B, gained more than 11% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

The initial signs of recovery in advertising at Meta may help assuage some investor concerns over the heavy spending the firm has doled out on developing Zuckerberg's metaverse project. The slowdown in advertising and the big bet on artificial intelligence has proved costly for Meta, leading it to heavily slash expenses, particularly through tens of thousands of layoffs.

Zuckerberg has previously defended the belt-tightening as a necessary part of what he has called a ""year of efficiency."" But his message to analysts was noticeably more upbeat on Wednesday.

""When we started this work last year, our business wasn't performing as well as I wanted. But now we're increasingly doing this work from a position of strength,"" Zuckerberg said.

3. Tech earnings parade marches on

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will report its first quarter results after the close of U.S. trading on Thursday, rounding out a week of earnings from some of the biggest names in the U.S. technology industry.

Investors will be particularly keen to see just how deep a recent downturn in sales growth has been at the e-commerce behemoth's key cloud-computing division.

Amazon Web Services, or AWS, has in the past accounted for the lion's share of the group's total operating profit. But the unit has seen its revenue growth slump to 27% earlier this year, the lowest level since Amazon began separating cloud results from the broader company, as potential customers rein in technology spending amid worries over an impending economic downturn.

On Wednesday, Amazon also unveiled layoffs at both AWS and its human resources division as part of a sweeping round of job cuts that are estimated to impact 9,000 workers. Analysts expect the reduced expenses will help improve margins in the second half of 2023.

Along with Meta, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have also posted their latest earnings this week, with both sets of returns pointing to continued resilience in cloud spending and advertising sales.

4. U.S. House passes debt ceiling bill

The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Wednesday that would raise the country's debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion as the threat of an upcoming default looms.

In a narrow 217-215 vote that had zero Democratic support, the Republican-controlled lower chamber of the U.S. Congress passed a measure that featured cuts to government spending plans backed by the Biden administration, including a proposed cancellation of some student loan debt.

Lawmakers now face a deadline, estimated to be sometime in June, for the federal government to avoid default. But the politics around the debt ceiling remain deeply complex, with Biden and Democratic leaders in Congress already accusing Republicans of using the issue to gain concessions on key policy areas.

Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House Speaker credited with shepherding through the passage of the bill, has said that Biden ""should sit down and negotiate."" For his part, Biden has said he is happy to meet with McCarthy, but not over whether the debt limit gets extended.

However the matter shakes out, fears are growing that the U.S. government may not be able to meet its debt obligations should the talks over $31.4T borrowing limit fail. Many investors are racing to snap up short-term government debt that matures before the ominous so-called ""X-date"" when extraordinary measures put in place by the Treasury Department earlier this year to prevent a default expire. Debt that matures in midsummer, meanwhile, is being avoided, causing massive distortions in the short-term T-bill market.

5. U.S. crude inventories fall, but oil demand concerns persist

Oil prices edged higher on Thursday due in part to a drop in weekly U.S. crude inventories that was far bigger than anticipated.

U.S. crude stocks decreased by about 5.1 million barrels last week, following a 4.6M-barrel drawdown in the prior week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration released late Wednesday. The reading was expected to show a 1.5M-barrel decrease.

By 05:17 ET, U.S. crude futures were 0.19% higher at $74.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.30% to $77.95 per barrel.

But both benchmarks are on course to post losses of almost 4% this week, close to a one-month low, as concerns remain over how a possible slowdown in economic growth will hit future oil demand. Oil prices have largely erased gains made on the back of a surprise production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies at the start of this month.

117,2023-06-14T11:18:37+00:00,UPDATE 2-Russia's Yandex delivers quarterly profit with 54% revenue rise,"(Updates with analyst comments, details)

By Alexander Marrow and Gleb Stolyarov

April 27 (Reuters) - Russian tech giant Yandex exceeded analysts' expectations on Thursday with a 54% jump in first quarter revenue to 163.3 billion roubles ($2 billion) and a return to profit after posting a net loss in the same period last year.

Since Moscow sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022 the company often dubbed ""Russia's Google"" has struggled to balance domestic pressures with the interests of its Western investors.

Alphabet's Google stopped selling online advertising in Russia last March, while keeping some free services available, allowing Yandex to gain market share.

Meanwhile, its Dutch-registered holding company plans to divest ownership and control of most of the Yandex Group.

Yandex's core earnings and profits were sharply depressed in the first quarter of 2022 as the Russian company made a one-off 5.9 billion-rouble payment to employees.

But analysts were still surprised at the jump to adjusted net income of 2.6 billion roubles in the first quarter of 2023, from an 8.1 billion rouble net loss a year earlier.

Revenue growth was driven by investments in advertising technologies, Yandex said. The reduced presence of key competitors also proved beneficial, helping push its search and portal market share to an average of 63.3%, from 61% a year ago.

Spending on e-commerce and food delivery contributed to a 36% increase in total operating expenses, Yandex said.

Growth of the e-commerce division's gross merchandise volume (GMV) slowed to 67%, from 90% last quarter, which Renaissance Capital analysts described as ""a bit disappointing"", but this was offset by stronger-than-expected performances elsewhere.

The GMV of Yandex's mobility services, which includes ride-hailing, carsharing and scooters, rose 34% year-on-year. Last week, Yandex bought Uber out of their joint venture for $702.5 million to become the sole owner of Yandex.Taxi.

This is a big week for tech stocks.

Todayâs results from Amazon will wrap up a string of earnings announcements whose impact will be felt well beyond the sector itself. Just five tech stocks have accounted for two thirds of the S&Pâs 8pc rise so farÂ this year, a much bigger proportion than the fifth of the indexâs capitalisation they represent.

The last year has been a roller-coaster for the US marketâs most influential stocks. Shares plunged between spring and autumn 2022 and have rallied strongly over the past six months.

This weekâs first quarter earnings numbers will help determine whether the recovery to date is justified or wishful thinking. Early signs from Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet exceeded expectations.

To understand where tech stocks go next, itâs worth dwelling on why 2022 was so bad. The key driver was the unexpectedly rapid rise in interest rates.

Tech stocks, like all high growth shares, are vulnerable to monetary tightening. Thatâs because much of their value is accounted for by expectations about future growth. The present-day value of future cash flows is magnified when the discounting calculation is based on a low interest rate.

So, the Fedâs determination to get on top of inflation last year was a negative for technology share prices even before you consider the impact of higher rates on broader economic activity. It goes some way to explaining why Amazon, for example, lost half its value between March and the end of last year. Or why Appleâs market capitalisation fell from $3trn to $2trn over the same period.

The jury is out on whether we should view technology shares as high growth cyclicals or defensives. But the second reason for last yearâs slump was the shortening odds on a damaging recession.

Historically, central banks have tightened until something breaks and tech stocks cannot be expected to swerve an economic slowdown. This weekâs reported growth in search advertising and better-than-expected cloud revenues suggest the sector may be more resilient than feared.

Story continues

The third headwind for tech stocks last year was simply overvaluation. During the first 18 months or so of the pandemic, the sector looked like the major beneficiary of Covid lockdowns. Re-tooling corporate infrastructure to accommodate newÂ ways of remote working was a major windfall for hardware and software businesses alike. And, unsurprisingly, the companies believed their own hype and over-expanded. They are now rowing back.

Other negatives last year included high and persistent inflation, damaged supply chains, a rising dollar which reduced the value of overseas earnings, and a shift from growth to value by investors looking for returns today rather than the promise of them tomorrow.

But just as there is no bad weather, only the wrong clothes, tech investing looks like a case of wrong price at the wrong time rather than wrong sector. Having been significantly over-priced at the end of 2021, tech shares started to look compelling six months ago.

You could tell something interesting was going on when value-focused investors like Dodge & Cox started buying growth-focused stocks like Amazon.

Shares fell last year to such an extent that tech stocks began to look cheaper in some cases than the market as a whole. Metaâs valuation fell from 26 times earnings to 16, less than the average multiple for the S&P 500. Google-owner Alphabet was valued at over 30 times earnings at its peak but fell to 17. Microsoft slid from a price-earnings ratio of 34 to just 21.

Did we reach a turning point at the end of last year? For that to be so and for the recent rally to go further from here, investors will want to see evidence that the sectorâs margins are sustainable.

Key to that will be the extent to which the job cuts that started to be announced at the beginning of the year are maintained.

Second, it must become clear that the pandemic-era upgrades were more than a flash in the pan. The move to the cloud is key to the next wave of corporate spending. Third, the teething problems with AI must be overcome so that investors can reassure themselves that a new surge of innovation can kick start the next phase of growth.

In the short term, the Fed must play its part too. Next monthâs rate-setting meeting will be vital to sentiment in the sector. If investors start to believe that interest rates have peaked and will start to fall to a new normal in the second half of 2023, then those valuations can regain their accustomed premium.

We have, of course, been here before. The bursting of every stock market bubble in history has been punctuated with sometimes sharp counter-trend rallies.

In March 2000, the Nasdaq index peaked at just over 5,000, having quintupled since 1995. By May of that year, the tech-dominated benchmark had lost 40pc of its value before recouping half of that loss by July to stand above 4,000. Two years later it was 1,100.

History does not repeat itself. Tech valuations were a lot higher in 2000 than they were in 2021 and these companies are no longer just hopes for the future but essential contributors to our business and personal lives now. It is, however, a salutary reminder that investors can hold onto their previous beliefs long after they are no longer serving them.

What happens to the tech sector matters to us all. If you are invested in a global tracker fund, a tenth of your investment will be held in just three stocks â Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.

The next biggest investments will be in Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta. Only then will you get to the first non-tech stock â ExxonMobil. A big week for tech is a big week for all of our investments.

The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.

The business world's obsessions with artificial intelligence has, in just a few short months, become a punchline of sorts.

AI also has the potential to be everything its biggest boosters believe it to be. And more.

Over the last few days, consumer companies including Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) have talked about the role AI could play in their business.

As purveyors of soft drinks, salty snacks, and burritos, it is hard to see where AI enhancements to workflows and best practices might really shake things up for these businesses.

Other than, of course, lowering costs in businesses that are already relentlessly managed to maximize profits.

Results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), however, more concretely brought home the reason AI's potential ought to be taken seriously as matching the runaway hype.

And as readers may likely anticipate, it is because of how AI has changed the thinking companies have around search that profound impacts may come to pass.

As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer noted Wednesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday on a call with investors, ""As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entry points across Bing, Edge, Windows and OpenAI's ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search.""

Last week, we argued tech's obsession with AI was actually about a war happening in search. This view was, and continues to be, fueled by simply reading the comments of the CEO of the most powerful enterprise tech company in the world.

Story continues

But if we broaden the notion of ""search"" beyond the walls of consumers looking for restaurants or new running sneakers, what we're really talking about is how data is collated, warehoused, and searched.

Many investors will hear consumer goods companies talk about AI and recall the days of every company feeling compelled to comment on ""blockchain."" Which has, to some extent, still not worn off â just on Wednesday, economic commentator Larry Summers said he is long blockchain and short bitcoin (BTC-USD).

As Julie Hyman wrote Wednesday, some Wall Street strategists have tabbed hype around AI as boosting the stock market this year.

But to invoke another investing clichÃ© from years gone by, if data really is the new oil, then how companies extract and understand that data will determine which earn the outsized returns promised by tech's latest revolution.

In its most recent quarters, Alphabet earned $17.4 billion in operating income; Microsoft recognized $18.3 billion in net income over the same period.

The opportunity AI presents is to grow these winnings many times over.

And that's no punchline for investors.

128,2023-06-14T08:06:14+00:00,Amazon earnings preview: Here's what to expect,"Amazon (AMZN) will report its Q1 2023 earnings Thursday after market close.

Investors are looking for updates on the e-commerce giant's cost-cutting efforts, an upward trend for retail margins, and a solid showing from cloud division Amazon Web Services, or simply AWS.

Here are the key numbers that Wall Street's expecting to see from Amazon this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg:

Net sales: $124.7 billion

EPS: 20 cents

AWS net sales: $21.03 billion

Operating margin: 2.38%

Q2 net sales guidance: $130.1 billion

AWS will be a point of focus for investors. Both Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) bucked worries about a cloud slowdown earlier this week, dialing up the pressure on AWS to deliver. Google Cloud hit a milestone, clocking profitability for the first time, and Microsoft, leaning on its AI prowess, talked Wall Street into forgiving that Azure's growth has been declining every quarter since at least Q3 2022.

So, AWS may or may not stack up on Thursday, but it's possible that AWS weakness is also already priced into Amazon, according to UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley, who has the stock rated at a Buy with a price target of $125. Hagerstown, MD, USA. Image of an Amazon packages. Amazon is an online company and is the largest retailer in the world.

""We remain constructive on AMZN shares over a 12-month view and think that line of sight to an eventual AWS stabilization is the focus among investors,"" he wrote on April 24. ""We do not expect to get that this [quarter]. But sentiment is so weak and we think investors expect continued weakness already.""

Additionally, updates on retail margins and ""broader context"" on cost-cutting will be important topics on the company's earnings call, as will how the company is ""positioned for Generative AI for AWS or otherwise,"" Walmsley noted.

Amazon has announced plans to lay off a total of 27,000 employees over the last few months. On Wednesday, the company reportedly fired off a round of layoffs hitting both HR and at AWS. Previously, the company conducted layoffs in highly-visible segments of the business such as Alexa and gaming.

CryptBot malware, also known as ""info stealer"" because it identifies and steals sensitive information from victims' computers, like authentication credentials, social media account logins, and cryptocurrency wallets, Google mentioned in itsÂ blog. CryptBot then sends the stolen data to bad actors to use inÂ data breach campaigns. CryptBot distributors offer maliciously modified versions of many software packages, including Google Earth Pro and Google Chrome. Users download and install these packages without realizing that doing so infects their machines with malware. Recent CryptBot versions aim to specifically target users of Google Chrome, where Google's CyberCrimes Investigations Group (CCIG) and Threat Analysis Group (TAG) teams worked to identify the distributors, investigate and take action. Google prosecuted several of CryptBot's significant distributors, likely based in Pakistan, involving claims, including computer fraud, abuse, and trademark infringement. The court has granted a temporary restraining order allowing Google to take down current and future domains tied to the distribution of CryptBot. Google's initiative will slow new infections from occurring and decelerate the growth of CryptBot. Price Action: GOOG shares traded higher by 2.26% at $106.81 on the last check Thursday.

132,2023-06-13T19:35:22+00:00,"Google Cloud partners with Polygon Labs, adding yet again to its growing roster of Web3 firms","Google Cloud announced on Thursday an expansive partnership with Polygon Labs, which develops software for and supports the Polygon ecosystem of blockchains.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

As part of the tie-up, the cloud computing giant will add support for Polygon, a collection of layer 2 blockchains built on top of Ethereum, to its Blockchain Node Engine. Currently, the Blockchain Node Engine, a streamlined means for developers to access and use blockchains on Googleâs servers, only supports Ethereum and Solana.

Moreover, Google Cloud will build out infrastructure to support Polygon zkEVM, a new blockchain within the Polygon ecosystem recently released to much fanfare, and by the end of the third quarter, it will also help developers deploy application-specific blockchains built with Polygon tech on its servers.

âGoogle Cloud supporting all of the Polygon protocols is a step in the right direction to help onboard more people into Web3,"" Ryan Wyatt, president of Polygon Labs, said in a statement.

And finally, Googleâs cloud computing arm will provide startups backed by Polygon Venturesâa fund that invests in businesses building on Polygonâwith a number of benefits, including credits to spend on hosting software on Google Cloudâs servers and access to the cloud services providerâs newly announced Web3 startup program. In fact, Google Cloud had already announced on Tuesday that successful applicants to the Web3 startup program are eligible to access a pot of $3 million in dedicated funding from the Polygon Ventures Ecosystem Fund, among other perks.

âThe industry is experiencing a flight to quality as corporations seek to minimize risk when exploring new possibilities in Web3,â Mitesh Agarwal, a managing director at Google Cloud, said in a statement.

Story continues

Despite the ongoing chill of Crypto Winter and a regulatory crackdown from the U.S. government, Google Cloudâs tie-up with Polygon Labs is further evidence of the cloud computing giantâs accelerating flurry of attention to Web3 from late 2022 through 2023.

In the first half of 2022, Google Cloud announced the formation of its digital assets and Web3 engineering teams. Then, after a ramp-up period, it began a steady campaign as it partnered with labs and foundations to support a number of blockchains, including BNB Chain, Solana, Aptos, Tezos, Casper, and Celo.

Google Cloudâs partnership with Polygon Labs, however, is more extensive than many of its prior affiliations with blockchain protocols. Its support for Celo, for example, boiled down to an extension of its existing Google for Startups Cloud Program to the blockchain's developers. While the cloud computing giant is extending similar benefits to Polygon developers, itâs also tailoring its infrastructure to Polygonâs ecosystem, which has recently claimed a large number of brand-name clients, including Starbucks and Mastercard.

By now you are probably tired of constantly hearing and reading about the AI mania in the news. But if you are into investing and want to make money off of AI, you are in for a long, probably never-ending news cycle of AI since companies are just getting started in AI innovation and the coming years and decades will be full of opportunities and novel achievements by AI algorithms. A lot has been said about ChatGPT, chatbots, Microsoftâs integration of AI tools and Googleâs AI plans. Letâs talk some numbers that quantify the real effects of the latest AI breakthroughs.

Still a Nascent Market

A report by Brookings titled âThe Geography of AIâ quotes estimates from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which say AI contribution to GDP in North America could reach a whopping $3.7 trillion by 2030.

The report shares several stats which show that the AI market, despite its dramatic growth, is still nascent. For example, the report cites stats from startup data platform Crunchbase, which show that despite the rapid advancement and numerous launches of AI companies over the past decade, AI startups account for just about 5% of new technology firms each year in the U.S.

The report also takes a look at the AI-related jobs posted on different jobs platforms. Hereâs what the Brookings report says on this front:

According to data from Burning Glass Technologies, an analytics software company, AI job postings as a share of all job postings quadruped in the past decade. However, those job additions still account for a tiny fraction in the U.S. labor market. In 2019, there were about 160,000 AI job postings in the United States, which was less than 10% of the 2 million total IT job postings, and only 0.7% of all job postings. Despite the excitement around accelerated AI adoption since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the business world, both the total number of AI jobs and the share of AI job postings experienced a slight decline in 2020.

""The Next Big Thing is Here, And Everywhere""

T. Rowe Price published a report on AI back in 2017 which looks prescient in hindsight. The report foresaw what was coming an accurately pointed out the AI advances coming in the domains of natural language and training data. Hereâs what the report, titled AI: The Next Big Thing is Here, And Everywhere, said:

Robots and automated devices will not be taking over the world anytime soon, but computer systems are being trained to analyze more like humansâbut with greater speed and accuracy. They are programmed to handle such complex tasks as understanding natural language, visual perception, and speech and text recognition and translation.

What the report didnât foresee was who will take a lead in the AI race in the future. The report at the time mentioned the obvious names who were expected to gain market share in the AI industry. These included Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft, Tesla, Facebook and Alibaba. The report specifically highlighted the advantage Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had in the market. Quoting Josh Spencer, portfolio manager of Global Technology Equity Strategy, the report said:

âArtificial intelligence will further advantage the massive players given a scarce talent pool and the importance of high-scale computing capacity and large proprietary data sets. Itâs a matter of the strong getting stronger. AI is not typically the main reason we invest in these successful companies, but itâs becoming more important. AI is maybe 10% of the investment case at Google now, but itâs a very important 10%.â

But who could have thought that a company named OpenAI would releases a tool five years down the road that would instantly threaten Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) core business model and force it to rethink its priorities, along with jolting major behemoths like Facebook.

For this article we first listed down at least 30 companies that are working in the AI industry, providing AI-related software or hardware solutions or are investing resources in R&D related to AI. We then narrowed down our list to 10 companies whose analyst price targets are much higher than the current stock prices. The idea was to find promising AI stocks whose stock prices are poised to grow according to Wall Street analysts. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors, which was taken from Insider Monkeyâs database of 943 hedge funds.

Most Promising AI Stocks According to Analysts

10. Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2

Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI) uses AI-driven models for cancer treatment development. In March, Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI) posted results for the year ended December 31, 2022.

As of the end of the last quarter of 2022, 2 hedge funds had stakes in Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI). Ken Griffinâs Citadel Investment Group owns a $27 million stake in Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI).

9. Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2

Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) uses AI to develop learning programs. Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) has gained over 60% over the past 30 days through April 20. Most of the gains were courtesy of Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST)âs launch of its new learning platform that is enabled by GPT-4. The new platform provides the companyâs customers with AI-assisted learning features.

As of April 20 Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) was trading at around $4.1. According to CNN Business, one analyst is covering the stock with a $40 price target, which shows a huge upside potential from the current levels.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 2 hedge funds had stakes in Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST).

8. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40

Chinese internet search giant Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been using AI in search, self-driving technologies and other platforms it operates for a long time. But Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) earlier this year rose after it was reported that the company was working on a ChatGPT-like service, called Ernie bot, and plans to integrate it with its platforms.

However, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) took a hit last month after the company cancelled its planned event to demo the Ernie bot. Nonetheless it remains one of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.

7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is rolling out a plethora of tools and features to integrate AI with its product suite. These include Generation AI, Adobe Firefly, new AI features for Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Sensei, the companyâs AI and ML technology that operates across the Adobe platform, including Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 99 hedge funds had stakes in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The total value of these stakes was $8.4 billion. The biggest stakeholder of the company is Terry Smithâs Fundsmith LLP which owns a $710 million stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âOne area we are watching regarding Alphabet andÂ Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a companyâs profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.

As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.â

6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 113

Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) earlier this month jumped in the AI arena by announcing the launch of Tongyi Qianwen, its large language model, as an app accessible to a wider audience. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) said Tongyi Qianwen will be integrated with all business applications across Alibabaâs ecosystem. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)âs Cloud platform already offers several tools and services to develop AI applications.

As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 113 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), up from 105 hedge funds in the previous quarter. The biggest stakeholder of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is Philippe Laffontâs Coatue Management which owns a $441 million stake in the company.

L1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long +16%) shares performed strongly based on favourable sentiment surrounding Chinaâs re-opening and indications from Chinese authorities that the prolonged restructuring process of Alibaba/Ant Financial was finally drawing to a close. The company remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud. We exited our position in January at around US$116 per share with the shares having rallied more than 90% since their early November lows and our China re-opening catalyst having played out. We subsequently re-entered the position in March with the shares having pulled back and with the company announcing a new organisational and governance structure. Alibaba has announced plans to split into six major business groups â Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group. Each of these groups will be managed independently (separate CEO and board) and have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this announcement is a strong catalyst to unlock the inherent sum-of-the-parts valuation discount in the company.â

136,2023-06-13T13:02:58+00:00,"Mark Zuckerberg says AI boosts monetization by 30% on Instagram, 40% on Facebook","Meta (META) stock hit a new 52-week high on Thursday as investors celebrated the companyâs return to revenue growth. One of the key drivers: artificial intelligence.

Further integration of A.I.helped drive Metaâs first revenue increase in three quarters, the company said on Wednesday. Reels monetization is up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook on a quarterly basis as A.I. plays a larger role in the platforms.

Time spent on Instagram went up by 24% since Meta launched A.I.-powered Instagram reels.

â(Generative A.I.) is going to also help create more engaging experiences, which should create more engagement,â Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the companyâs earnings call Wednesday evening. âAnd that by itself creates more opportunities for advertisers.â

In the first quarter, Meta delivered advertising revenue of $28.1 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $26.76. The companyâs $2.20 earnings per share also topped analyst expectations of $2.01. Meta projects second quarter revenue in a range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion, above estimates of $29.48 billion.

The stock of the company, formerly known as Facebook, rose as much as 14% in intraday trading on Thursday.

A.I. is having its moment on tech earnings calls for the second consecutive quarter, following the widely popular launch of OpenAIâs ChatGPT in late November. But not every company has the same plans for the new technology.

Nvidia (NVDA) is selling A.I. powered supercomputers. Microsoft (MSFT) is integrating ChatGPT into its search engine to compete with Google (GOOGL), which has its own A.I. searchbot.

Metaâs approach is slightly different. The core business for Meta since the early days of Facebook has been advertising sales, which still account for 98% of the companyâs quarterly revenue. So naturally, enhancing advertisements with A.I. is where Meta believes the new technology can be most impactful.

âWe're just playing a different game on the infrastructure than companies like Google or Microsoft or Amazon, and that creates different incentives for us,â Zuckerberg said when explaining why Meta is open-sourcing its A.I.

Story continues Users are resharing Reels more than 2 billion times every day according to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Metaâs pushinto A.I. comes as the company is still bleeding from its steep Metaverse investments. Metaâs Reality Labs reported an operating loss of $4 billion in the first quarter, compared to an operating loss of $3 billion in the same period last year.

Those losses had weighed heavily on Metaâs stock in the past, but amid Metaâs âyear of efficiency,â cost-cutting efforts and A.I. benefits have Wall Street turning more bullish. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank research analyst Benjamin Black highlighted AI-driven ad performance as a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth through the rest of 2023.

âThe improvement in Meta's (A.I. and machine learning) capabilities are not only improving Reels' content ranking and recommendation algorithm, which in turn drives user engagement, but [it]also increases the efficiency of ad delivery, which increases monetization of the service,â Black wrote.

Zuckerberg noted on the earnings call he feels Meta is âno longer behind"" in building out an A.I. infrastructure. Now, the focus shifts to finding new ways to integrate and optimize the technology.

âThis is literally going to touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways,â Zuckerbeg said. âThis is just a very big wave and new set of technologies that's available, and we're working on it across the whole company.

139,2023-06-13T11:18:39+00:00,15 Largest PC Companies in the World,"In this article, we take a closer look at the 15 largest PC companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis and head straight to our list of 5 largest PC companies in the world.

The International Data Corporation (IDC) has released preliminary results indicating that during the first quarter of 2023 (1Q23), traditional PC shipments dropped by 29.0% compared to the same period in 2022. Canalys reports an even steeper drop of 33%, indicating a worrying trend for the industry.

The drop was due to low demand, excess inventory, and an unstable global economy. In the first quarter of 2023, global shipments amounted to 56.9 million, which indicates a decline as during the first quarter of 2022, the global shipments were 80.2 million.

IDC highlights that due to the current slowdown in growth and demand, factories are now considering producing PCs outside of China. The pause in demand has also given PC makers time to reorganize their plans for 2023, as they are currently placing orders for Chromebooks before licensing costs increase later. Although there may be a temporary decrease in PC shipments, the industry is expected to recover towards the end of 2023.

Key players

The largest PC companies worldwide were also not immune to this contraction. During Q1 2023, the top five PC giants with the most significant market share experienced double-digit shipment declines. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) performed the worst with a 40.5% difference compared to Q1 2022.

Lenovo maintained its position as the global leader in total shipments with 12.7 million units and a market share of 22.4% despite facing a hard time in the US market. Although the company experienced the sharpest decline in annual shipments in its corporate history over two quarters, it saw modest growth in Japan due to end-of-fiscal-year PC purchases in 2022.

HP Inc (NASDAQ:HPQ) ranked second in the global PC market with 12 million shipments and a 21.1% market share. However, the company experienced its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit shipment decline. While HP shipments in the EMEA region dropped by 37% compared to the same period last year, the decline in the US market was less severe.

Story continues

Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:Dell) held the third position with 9.5 million shipments, representing 16.7% of the market share. The company recorded its fourth consecutive quarter of decline, and its Asia Pacific market was severely affected, with an over 40% decline. The weak PC market was the primary factor contributing to Dell's decline.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) held the fourth position in the market with 4.1 million shipments, representing a 7.2% market share. Asus followed in fifth place with 3.9 million shipments, accounting for 6.8% of the market.

Quantum Computing in Development

Tech giants are currently investing in the development of quantum computing technology. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has set a goal of building a quantum computer by 2029, while International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) plans to have a 1,000-qubit quantum computer in place by 2023. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is offering access to quantum technology through its Azure Quantum platform, and there is also interest from financial-services companies such as JPMorgan Chase and Visa.

According to Medium, Quantum computers, such as Google's Sycamore, are significantly faster than classical computers or supercomputers. For example, Sycamore could calculate a narrow-range problem in 200 seconds that would take IBM's Summit supercomputer 10,000 years to solve.

Quantum computing can disrupt the traditional computing industry by providing much faster and more powerful computing capabilities. However, quantum computing is limited to a very narrow range of applications. For these kinds of applications, the demand could shift from traditional PCs to quantum computing services offered by companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

The Emerging Edge Computing

Gartner predicts that 80% of enterprises will shut down their traditional data centers by 2025 due to the latency issues of traditional cloud computing, which relies on servers in one central location. As a result, many companies are shifting towards edge-computing service providers that bring computation, data storage, and analytics closer to the end-user location, resulting in improved response times. Content Delivery Networks like Cloudflare are making edge computing accessible and are expected to power the web in the future.

For the largest PC companies, this could involve developing more powerful and efficient processors and integrating edge computing capabilities into their products. Additionally, PC companies may need to collaborate with edge computing service providers like Cloudflare to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. Finally, as more businesses adopt edge computing, there may be increased demand for PC products with enhanced security features to protect sensitive data being processed at the edge.

Zero Trust: The Future of Data Protection

The Zero Trust model, a modern security architecture, provides security against ransomware and cybersecurity threats by assigning the least required access needed to perform specific tasks.

Large companies like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) invest heavily in developing Zero Trust solutions, quickly becoming the best practice in any industry. It explains why International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) reports that the data breaches cost companies $4.35 million on average, globally.

Adopting zero-trust security models has multiple implications for the largest PC companies in the world. It will require them to invest in sophisticated security tools, ensure compatibility with the framework, and offer devices with built-in security features such as biometric authentication, encryption, and secure boot processes. 15 Largest PC Companies in the World

140,2023-06-13T10:16:01+00:00,"Amazon earnings: Results beat expectations across the board, stock soars","Amazon (AMZN) reported first quarter earnings on Thursday that beat expectations and sent shares soaring in after hours trading.

Amazon stock popped as much as 10% late Thursday as investors digested revenues, profits, margins, and current quarter guidance that all beat Wall Street expectations.

""Thereâs a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.

The company's efforts to rein in costs, which cost Amazon about $500 million in the first quarter, are expected to be a central focus on the company's earnings call Thursday evening. The company has announced plans to lay off a total of 27,000 employees over the last few months.

Here are the most important numbers from Amazon's report, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Net sales: $127.36 actual versus $124.7 billion estimated EPS: 31 cents actual versus 20 cents estimated Amazon Web Services (AWS) net sales: $21.35 billion actual versus $21.03 billion estimated Operating margin: 3.7% actual versus 2.38% estimated Q2 net sales guidance: $127-133 billion actual versus $130.1 billion estimated

""Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023),"" Jassy said.

""Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands.""

While the company's AWS results this quarter will be a relief for Amazon investors, Jassy cautioned on prospects for the company's cloud business. He also linked AI with AWS's long-term plans.

""While our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI,"" Jassy said. ""We like the fundamentals weâre seeing in AWS, and believe thereâs much growth ahead.â

If there's one big bottom line here it's this: Amazon is growing again.

JOHN LEGEND CALLS FOR REGULATION ON AI-GENERATED MUSIC

The chairman said Microsoft is committed to ""leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it.""

READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, is shown during an interview on March 15, 2023.

Bloomberg reported that â in the past quarter â Google's search business appeared to be weathering increased competitive threats and a larger downturn in the digital advertising market. The outlet said the companyâs revenue from search and related businesses rose to almost $40.4 billion in the period that ended March 31.

During its call, Google, long the search-engine leader, had to discuss recent strides made by its competitor.

""So, how do you feel about Alphabet's ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft's ambitions to increase its share of paid search?"" Barclays analyst Ross Sandler asked. Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Microsoft Corp. turned their attention to artificial intelligence in recent earnings calls, with the tech giants' CEOs both touting achievements in online search.

""Look, I think these dynamics have always been around. It's important to remember â as far as I can remember, we have always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I can't comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users,"" Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said.

He said partners ultimately end up choosing Google because ""that's what their users want.""

""And that's always been what's helped search be widely distributed,"" Pichai said. ""So, I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve search and making sure we are â¦ leading there. So, I think we have always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I'm comfortable that we'll continue to be able to do so.""

Google leadership encouraged investors to place their trust in the company's history, saying investments in AI have well-positioned the company. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, speaks during an event in New Delhi on Dec. 19, 2022.

Pichai said that their process going forward would be guided by data and years of experience, continuing to incorporate generative AI advances to improve search.

""So, first of all, throughout the years, we have gone through many, many shifts in search,"" he told, responding to a query from Merrill Lynch Managing Director Justin Post. ""And as we have evolved search, I think weâve always had a strong, grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provides value to users.""

""Advertisers want to reach users. And so, all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And, as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go,"" Pichai said. ""And I feel comfortable we'll be able to drive innovation here like we've always done."""

Revenue in Amazon's AWS unit grew 16% during the first quarter, down from an annual growth rate of 37% seen in the same quarter last year.

Olsavsky sought to cushion the blow of this guidance by telling investors, ""we're not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We're working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us.""

Amazon stock popped as much as 10% late Thursday as investors digested revenues, profits, margins, and current quarter guidance that all blew past Wall Street's expectations.

Here are the headline numbers from Amazon's report, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:

Net sales: $127.36 actual versus $124.7 billion estimated EPS: 31 cents actual versus 20 cents estimated Amazon Web Services (AWS) net sales: $21.35 billion actual versus $21.03 billion estimated Operating margin: 3.7% actual versus 2.38% estimated Q2 net sales guidance: $127 billion - $133 billion actual versus $130.1 billion estimated

""Thereâs a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,"" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the earnings statement.

The company's efforts to rein in costs, which ran Amazon about $500 million in the first quarter, are expected to be a central focus on the company's earnings call Thursday evening. The company announced plans to lay off a total of 27,000 employees over the last few months.

""Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023),"" Jassy said.

""Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands.""

On the company's earnings call, both Jassy and Olsavsky also spoke about the still-wary customer, both on the e-commerce and AWS sides of the business.

""We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty,"" said Olsavsky.

This in some ways mirrors what Amazon is seeing among cloud customers, Jassy added.

""In AWS, what we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time,"" he told analysts. ""Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost-optimizing versus cost-cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences.""

Much of the initial excitement around Amazon's quarter, however, can be seen in the growth that returned to some parts of the business.

In its North America retail operations, for instance, the company's gone back to making money. This time last year, the segment was operating at a loss of more than $1.5 billion in the three months leading up to March 31, 2022. This year, this segment reported operating income of $898 million.

Another case in point: Last year, in Q1 2022, online stores sales declined 1% year-over-year. In the first quarter of this year, sales rose 3%.

145,2023-06-12T22:21:05+00:00,"Asian stocks rebound tracking Wall Street gains, dovish BOJ","Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose sharply from recent lows on Friday, tracking an overnight bounce in Wall Street following a series of strong earnings, while a dovish outlook from the Bank of Japan sparked a rally in the Nikkei.

Still, most regional indexes were set to close the week flat or lower, amid persistent concerns over worsening economic growth and rising interest rates.

Japanâs Nikkei 225 index jumped 0.8% after the Bank of Japan held interest rates at record lows and said it will ""patiently"" continue with its quantitative easing and yield curve control measures.

The move points to accommodative conditions for Japanese stocks, which is likely to facilitate more buying into markets flush with liquidity.

But the bank slightly hiked its inflation outlook for fiscal 2023. Data on Friday also showed inflation in Tokyo, Japan's capital, rose more than expected in April. The reading heralds a similar trend in nationwide inflation, and could signal growing pressure on the BOJ to eventually tighten policy this year - a possibility that new Governor Kazuo Ueda has raised.

Broader Asian markets rose, recovering a measure of their losses this week as technology-heavy bourses were supported by a series of stronger-than-expected earnings from major U.S. tech firms.

Hong Kongâs Hang Seng index added 0.9%, while the Taiwan Weighted index rose 0.8%. Wall Street indexes surged on Thursday, led chiefly by the Nasdaq Composite following stronger-than-expected earnings from Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). Earlier this week, peers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had also logged strong earnings growth.

Indian stocks were the best performers in Asia this week, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex 30 indexes trading at two-month highs after a string of strong local earnings largely offset weak global cues. Both indexes were set to add more than 1.6% this week.

Financials played a key role in the Indian stock rally, following consensus-beating results from Bajaj Finance Ltd (NS:BJFN) and ICICI Bank Ltd (NS:ICBK). Reliance Industries Ltd (NS:RELI), Indiaâs largest company by market capitalization, also logged a 19% jump in its quarterly profit.

Story continues

Chinaâs Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes added about 0.7% each as they extended a recovery from nearly four-month lows hit earlier in the week. Australia's ASX 200 added 0.1%.

But sentiment towards broader Asian markets remained largely cautious, as softer-than-expected U.S. GDP data soured sentiment towards risk-driven assets. Stronger-than-expected inflation and labor market readings also pushed up concerns over more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, ahead of a meeting next week.

If you are only interested in the top ones, go to the 5 Most Profitable Businesses With Least Investment in 2023.

Starting a business can be an exciting and fulfilling endeavor, but it can also be expensive. However, there are several types of businesses that require little investment and can be started with minimal resources.Â  Thanks to the rise of e-commerce and online business models, starting a business with low investment has become easier than ever.

Navigating the Current Economic Climate

The recent surge in tech layoffs from major corporations such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Twitter has prompted many ex-employees as well as others, to embark on various entrepreneurial ventures, exploring opportunities to start their own businesses.

These layoffs by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Twitter have led to an interesting trend. According to Clarify Capital, almost 25% of the pink-slipped tech workers started their own businesses, indicating that being laid off can actually be an opportunity to start an entrepreneurial journey. Among those surveyed, 30% of these new business owners started their company within 6 months of being let go, while an additional 40% began their journey into self-employment within a year.

Amidst the current economic climate, employment uncertainty looms large, especially with the job volatility exhibited by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Twitter. In response, many individuals are exploring alternative sources of income, with some taking the leap to start their own businesses. For those seeking to embark on an entrepreneurial journey, low-investment businesses have become a viable option. Moreover, emerging business trends like e-commerce and the gig economy have created a fertile ground for small businesses to thrive and succeed.

Market Outlook

Small businesses have been responsible for creating two-thirds of all new jobs in the US in the past 25 years. Not only that, but the owners of these businesses have a positive outlook on their future prospects, with 76% believing they can weather the current economic challenges caused by rising inflation and rate hikes.

These ventures are making waves on a global scale, contributing around 45% to the global GDP and employing up to 60% of the global workforce. This highlights the significant impact that businesses can have on the global economy. Moreover, the small-business market share is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5% by 2030, indicating the potential for continued growth and success in the coming years.

Despite the economic downturn, there has been a surge in businesses & startups, with a record high of 5.4 million applications filed in 2021, a significant 53% increase from 2019. This is indicative of the enduring and growing entrepreneurial spirit in the US.

Small-scale businesses contribute significantly to the US GDP, accounting for 44% of it. Furthermore, most small business owners remain optimistic about the future, with 77% expecting growth. This positive outlook is a promising sign for those considering starting their own ventures.

One of the reasons for the success of many small businesses is their ability to leverage technology, digital tools, and artificial intelligence. This has helped them to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. In particular, the healthcare and food services sectors have experienced significant growth, with many successful small businesses operating in these industries.

Businesses like SEO and E-commerce are also popular options for those looking for profitable businesses with low startup costs and high-profit margins. These businesses rely heavily on digital tools and technology, which means that overhead costs can be kept to a minimum. As a result, they are often more accessible to aspiring entrepreneurs with limited resources.

Capitalizing on Emerging 2023 Business Trends

2023 is expected to bring several trends, which will impact the business landscape. To capitalize on these trends, investors should consider low-investment ventures with high profitability. Here are some of the trends to watch out for:

Sustainability

Sustainability is increasingly becoming a crucial aspect of businesses, and incorporating eco-friendly practices and products in your business can attract customers and churn high profits.

Digital Transformation

The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, making it essential for businesses to provide digital solutions. A business offering e-commerce, digital marketing, or cloud-based solutions can be highly profitable and requires minimal investment.

Health and Wellness

As health and wellness have become a top priority for many individuals, starting a business that provides health and wellness products and services can be a lucrative opportunity. Offering nutritional supplements, fitness equipment, or virtual fitness classes can garner a good profit with the least investment.

Remote Work

The pandemic has also changed the way people work, with remote work becoming more common. A business that offers virtual communication tools or cloud-based platforms can generate high profits.

Methodology

We used a systematic approach to determine 10 most profitable businesses with the least investment in 2023. Initially, we identified industries that have the highest net margins. We sourced our data from CSI, NYU Stern School of Business and Insider Monkey, among other sources, for this purpose, followed by an analysis of the capital investment required for each industry. The investment figures were estimated based on two to three credible sources. The businesses were then ranked in ascending order of high profitability-investment ratio.

Note: Different individual businesses in different industries can have high net margins due to individual circumstances, which can vary within the industry. Other factors can also impact margins, like location, demographics, among other factors. This list is based on a general analysis based on publicly available information of industry margins.

10. Online Academic Services

Net Margin: 7.17%

Minimum Initial Investment: $5,000

The online academic industry is currently experiencing substantial growth, with potential net margins of 7.17% and a projected CAGR of 14.9% between 2023 and 2030. This trend is expected to continue due to the increasing demand for virtual learning solutions, particularly as more students and professionals seek to enhance their knowledge and skills remotely.

The global online tutoring market was valued at $7.69 billion in 2022, highlighting the significant potential for growth in this sector. As a result, the future looks promising for tutoring businesses that are poised to capitalize on this trend and provide high-quality online tutoring services.

Net Margin: 10%

Minimum Initial Investment: $7,500

As noted by Statista, the E-commerce market is predicted to experience significant growth in the years ahead. The industry is projected to achieve a market volume of $6.35tn by 2027, with an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2027) of 11.51%. As per the estimates, user penetration is expected to increase from 57.2% in 2023 to 66.6% by 2027, underscoring its rising popularity among businesses and consumers alike.

Moreover, the average revenue per user (ARPU) is estimated to be approximately $930, indicating the potential for substantial profitability in the industry. E-commerce stores have the potential to be highly profitable while requiring a comparatively lower investment.

8. Virtual Event Planning

Net Margin: 15%

Minimum Initial Investment: $2,000

The global virtual event platform market has experienced significant growth, increasing from $11.99 billion in 2022 to $13.82 billion in 2023. This represents a CAGR of 15.3%, highlighting the increasing demand for virtual events.

7. Personalized Meal Planning

Net Margin: 9.28%

Minimum Initial Investment: $1,000

As per the findings of a Transparency Market Research report, the global meal planning market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 20.4% during the forecast period spanning from 2022 to 2031. The market's projected growth is primarily attributed to the burgeoning consumer demand for convenient and healthy eating options, along with a rising trend toward personalized meal planning.

The meal planning industry's average net margin falls at 9.28%, indicating a potentially profitable investment opportunity for prospective investors. A modest investment of $1,000 could prove sufficient to enter and capitalize on this burgeoning market.

6. Digital Marketing

Net Margin: 20.68%

Minimum Initial Investment: $1,800

Digital marketing is an excellent business to invest in, particularly for those with limited financial resources. With the widespread use of technology and the internet, digital marketing has become a vital aspect of modern-day marketing.

Meta's 'year of efficiency' pays off in Q1

Facebook operator Meta (NASDAQ:META) was recently flying 14% higher Wednesday after earnings smashed estimates amid its declared ""year of efficiency"" - employee headcount fell 1% in Q1 due to layoffs - and an uptick in ad revenue.

All in all, the company reported EPS of $2.20 versus the $2.02 average analyst estimate. Revenue of $28.65 billion was also ahead of consensus, and Meta said 2Q sales should range from $29.5B to $32B, above estimates of $29.47B.

JPMorgan boosted the stock's price target by $35 to $305 given the acceleration of revenue growth toward double digits. Goldman Sachs lifted the price target to $300 from the prior $245, noting:

""While some debates may persist around near-term revenue growth recovery/trajectory in the quarters ahead, we continue to see META as well-positioned against a number of long-term secular growth themes.""

InvestingPro subscribers got these headlines in real time, giving them an edge in their portfolios well before market open.

Amazon beats on Q1 but deflates investors with sour cloud revenue news

On Thursday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it earned $0.31 per share, easily surpassing analyst estimates of $0.21. Revenue was also better than expected at $127.4B.

The stock initially popped higher after hours on the results, which encompassed 16% growth at cloud revenue segment Amazon Web Services to $21.35B.

But shares reversed to a decline during the earnings call Thursday evening when the company said customers are tightening up spending on cloud services in Q2 amid ""tough economic conditions,"" leading to a 500-basis-point decline April revenue growth rates.

Story continues

Overall, the company expects Q2 revenue of $127.0B to $133B and operating income of $2.0B to $5.5B, in line with analyst expectations.

Shares were losing 2% in after-hours trading Thursday.

After Alphabet's positive Q1, say analysts, 'we'd be buyers of GOOGL shares'

Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines with earnings per share of $1.17 and revenue of $69.79B. The company also said it would buy back $70B in shares.

The stock initially rose on the announcement but lost ground in the regular session after the CFO started discussing aggressive capex outlook and hiring plans for 2023 on the earnings call.

Analysts highlighted strength in Alphabet's search business and positive momentum in cloud. Oppenheimer hiked the price target by $10 to $145, citing stabilizing ad trends.

And Roth MKM has a new price target on GOOGL stock, $134. The analysts said ""we'd be buyers of GOOGL shares"" ahead of several potential catalysts next month: ""Google I/O (May 10), Marketing Live (May 23), and the advertising industry's Upfronts and Newfronts events scattered across May.""

Microsoft delivers, leaving analysts 'impressed'

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) jumped 7% higher Wednesday on better-than-expected fiscal third quarter results as its cloud business underpinned performance, shrugging off fears that slowing consumer spending would weigh on growth.

EPS totaled $2.45, beating the $2.24 average Street estimate, and revenue also topped expectations at $52.9B, encompassing 31% top-line growth at key cloud business Azure.

Microsoft shares are up about 15% so far this year, riding on investor optimism about the tech giant's lead in the AI race following a multi-billion-dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

Oppenheimer lifted the stock's price target to $330 on the ""impressive"" results, while JPMorgan called the results ""resilient"" and also hiked its price target, to $315. JPMorgan assessed, ""AI was mentioned 50 times during the earnings call and is clearly driving a reassessment of Microsoftâs value prop and differentiation.""

The race for AI in web browsers intensified with Microsoftâs announcement earlier this year that it would roll out a new, AI-powered version of its Bing search engine and Edge web browser using ChatGPT â a tool developed by OpenAI through a partnership with Microsoft.

Market share for web browsers has been relatively stable in recent years despite a variety of options being available to consumers â a dynamic that the AI race threatens to upend and has led tech sector firms behind major browsers to make moves to integrate the new technology into their browsers and search engines.

GOOGLE, MICROSOFT IN Q1 EARNINGS PROVIDE UPDATES ON AI PUSH Microsoft recently launched new AI improvements for its Bing search engine and Edge browser, while Google is reportedly planning similar improvements for Chrome and Mozilla is doing likewise for Firefox.

Since Google Chrome overtook Microsoft Internet Explorer in 2012 as the most popular web browser, it more than doubled its worldwide share of browser usage from about 29% to more than 60% â a level it has remained above since 2018, according to StatCounter. The most recent data from March 2023 put Google Chromeâs market share at 64.8%, followed by Appleâs Safari at 19.5%, Microsoftâs Edge at 4.6% and Mozillaâs Firefox at 2.9%.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an earnings call this week that since the launch of the new AI-powered Bing search and Edge browser two months ago, ""Weâre making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter, and Bing once again grew share in the United States.""

In an earnings call this week, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai didnât go into detail about upcoming AI-related improvements to Chrome or search but said, ""We will continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way.""

""Right now, most AI tools are being developed by a handful of companies with a narrow set of incentives, like profit and engagement. We think consumers should have access to an alternative paradigm: AI that prioritizes incentives like human well-being and transparency.""

Mozilla indicated that itâs in the process of staffing up and fleshing out ideas for adding AI tools to Firefox and that more information will be announced in the months ahead.

151,2023-06-12T20:12:34+00:00,"Amazon's AWS warning, PCE ahead, European economic data - what's moving markets","Investing.com -- Amazon warns of a slowdown at its crucial cloud-computing division, while U.S. stock futures edge down after a fresh batch of other corporate results. Focus will turn to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge later today, but in the meantime traders are digesting major economic data out of Europe.

1. U.S. stock futures slip amid earnings deluge

U.S. stocks pointed lower on Friday as investors weighed a series of corporate earnings, including results from technology giant Amazon.

By 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 168 points of 0.50%, S&P 500 futures traded 20 points or 0.49% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 51 points or 0.39%.

Shares in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dropped more than 2% in after hours trading, reversing earlier gains. Meanwhile, chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) predicted that its margins would improve in the second half of 2023, giving a boost to shares postmarket.

Elsewhere, quarterly revenues at Snap (NYSE:SNAP) - the company behind photo-messaging app Snapchat - missed estimates following alterations to its advertising platform, sending shares into the red in extended trading. Image-sharing social media site Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) also saw its shares shed more than a tenth of their value after a slump in ad spending led to smaller-than-anticipated revenue growth in its second quarter.

Gaming and media conglomerate Sony (NYSE:SONY) reported on Friday that it expects profits to decline from a record high in its current fiscal period because of weakness at its financial services business.

Later today, oil majors Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) will be among the biggest names rounding out a busy week of corporate earnings.

2. Cloudy outlook for AWS

Amazon initially saw its stock rally following the release of its first quarter returns, which showed that revenue at its key cloud-computing unit Amazon Web Services - a major driver of the group's overall profit - had grown by more than expected to $21.4 billion. Overall group net sales of $127.36 billion also beat estimates.

Story continues

But the gains reversed after Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky warned in a call with analysts that customers using AWS were reining spending due to ""tough economic conditions."" As a result, sales growth rates in April were ""about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in [the first quarter],"" Olsavsky added.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that near-term growth prospects at AWS now look uncertain, although they remained positive about its prospects over a longer period of time.

Amazon's results came after reports from other U.S. tech giants this week, including Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). These firms have been slashing expenses, particularly through sweeping job cuts, in a bid to offset flagging spending by customers wary of the broader economic outlook.

3. Key Fed inflation gauge looms

A measure of inflation that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve is due out later today, with investors keen to find out just how much the U.S. central bank's recently aggressive monetary policy is impacting price growth.

The personal consumption expenditure index excluding volatile items like food and energy is predicted to have increased by 0.3% in March, in line with the prior month. On a year-on-year basis, the reading is forecast to slow to 4.5% from 4.6% in February.

The Fed has raised interest rates at an unprecedented clip over the past year in a bid to corral runaway inflation.

But the uptick in borrowing costs is starting to show signs that it is hitting overall growth. U.S. economic activity decelerated by more-than-anticipated to 1.1% in the first quarter, according to Commerce Department data released on Thursday, due in large part to rising rates and high inflation.

4. Eurozone growth slows

Economic growth in the Eurozone grew by less than projected in the first quarter, as stubbornly elevated prices and spiking interest rates weighed on overall activity.

Seasonally-adjusted gross domestic product in the currency area rose by 0.1% in the first three months of 2023, accelerating from stagnation in the fourth quarter but below economists' estimates for an uptick of 0.2%. On a year-on-year basis, GDP slowed by more than anticipated to 1.3% in the January to March period, down from the prior level of 1.8%.

Germany - the Eurozone's largest economy - did not grow despite hopes for a marginal expansion, although this was partly offset by a jump in output in France, Italy, and Spain.

Investors are watching today's data out of the region closely ahead of the European Central Bank's latest policy-setting meeting next week. The ECB is largely expected to raise rates in early May, although the size of that increase is still up for debate, along with any future hikes.

5. Oil prices choppy

Oil prices edged lower, erasing earlier gains, as traders digested data showing stagnating economic activity in Germany that added to disappointing U.S. growth in the first quarter.

By 04:45 EST, U.S. crude futures traded 0.87% lower at $74.11 a barrel, while the Brent contract dipped by 0.70% to $77.67.

Both benchmarks are on course to register declines of over 3% this week, bringing their drops to close to 10% over the past two weeks, as concerns over how a possible global slowdown, particularly in the U.S., the world's biggest importer of oil, could impact crude demand.

159,2023-06-12T12:00:52+00:00,US judge denies Google's motion to dismiss advertising antitrust case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. federal judge on Friday denied Google's motion to dismiss a Department of Justice antitrust case focused on advertising technology, saying the government's case was strong enough to go forward.

The government, which filed the ad tech lawsuit in January, has argued that Google should be forced to sell its ad manager suite. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

""I'm going to deny the defendant's motion to dismiss,"" Judge Leonie Brinkema said in a federal court in Virginia. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc.

Google's motion is the company's latest effort to end costly, time-consuming antitrust lawsuits. It also asked a federal court in Washington to dismiss claims in a 2020 lawsuit filed by the government.

Arguing for Google, Eric Mahr said that the Justice Department failed to allege a high enough market share, 70%, to be able to say that Google had market power.

Brinkema, however, said that there were factors beyond market share to consider, for example if a company was guilty of ""rapacious conduct.""

Brinkema also took issue with Mahr's argument that the government had reviewed Google's deals to buy DoubleClick and Admeld, both more than 10 years ago, to increase its clout in ad tech, noting that the government said it made a mistake.

Mahr also argued that the Justice Department failed to show that advertisers suffered any damages because of Google's actions. He also said the government improperly excluded Facebook and others in its definition of the market, calling them ""obvious substitutes.""

160,2023-06-12T09:21:00+00:00,Google Tops Expectations Despite Ad And Competitive Headwinds,"On April 25th, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) reported its first quarter revenues and earnings that topped expectations. Google-parent finally broke the spell after missing estimates for fourth quarters in a row while Meta Platforms Inc (NASAQ: META) also reported its sales rose after three quarters of declines.

Key First Quarter Figures

Revenue rose 3% YoY as it amounted to $69.79 billion, topping the $68.9 billion that Refinitivâs survey of analysts expected. The resulting earnings amounted to $1.17 per share, also topping the expected $1.07 per share.Â Net income dropped from last yearâs $16.44 billion, or $1.23 per share to $15.05 billion, or $1.17 per share.

Revenue Per Segment

YouTube advertising generated $6.69 billion to total revenue, topping StreetAccountâs $6.6 billion. Google Cloud revenue amounted to $7.45 billion, coming in slightly below StreetAccountâs estimate of $7.49 billion. Traffic acquisition costs amounted to $11.72 billion, also below Street Accountâs estimate of $11.78 billion.

Other bets that include the life science unit and self-driving company Waymo generatedÂ $288 million in revenues, which is quite a drop from last yearâs $440 million.

Cloud Computing Business Is Finally Making AÂ Profit

While Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) scared investors withÂ a cloud growth slow down, Google's cloud unit finaly came out of the woods.Â After last yearâs loss of $706 million, the cloud unit reported an operating income ofÂ $191 million.

Playing Catch-Up With Microsoft In The AI Field

Microsoftâs chatbot ChatGPT is giving Google a headache. In response, it launched its own AI-based chatbot Bardduring the quarter that is open to U.S. and UK users for testing purposes. The launch has been criticized for being rushed to compete with Microsoft who announced ChatGPT will be integrated in its Bing search engine, with Google warning Bardâs users of possible mistakes with some answers.

Extreme Cost Cuts To Deal With The Weak Ad Online Market

Fears of an upcoming recession have wreaked havoc on Google, as well as on Meta that reported anÂ unexpected increase in sales for the first quarterÂ onÂ April 27th.Â But Metaâs latest results gave hope for the online ad market whileÂ Google parent had to make the most extreme cost cuts in its history to deal with this challenging environment whose outlook is still very much uncertain. In January, it trimmed its workforce by 6%, letting goÂ 12,000 employees. More recently, CFO Ruth Porat announced âmulti-yearâ cuts in real estate, employee services and equipment.Â During the quarter, charges related to the layoffs and office space reduction amounted to $2.6 billion

Story continues

Its online ad peer Meta gave an optimistic outlook as well, forecasting that revenue would grow in the range between 2.4% and 11.1% in the undergoing, second, quarter. Although the top lineâs 3% growth is a far cry from the 25% to 30% growth rate that Meta used to regularly report back in the days it was known as Facebook, this figure gives hope that the digital ad business might be rebounding. Although Googleâs ad revenue exceeded analyst expectations, it dropped compared to last yearâs quarter to $54.55 billion. Google has also found itself in a more competitive landscape with YouTube competing with Tik Tok in the field of short videos.

The Latest Results Provide AÂ Beacon Of Hope But Things Are Far From How They Used To Be.

Despite topping estimates, Google has found itself in low single-digit revenue growth after nearly two decades of consistent and rapid growth. It still holdsÂ more than 90% of search market share but Googleâs shares went down more than 3% last week after New York Timesâ report that indicated Samsung is reportedly considering switching from Google to Microsoftâs Bing for its smartphone lineup. Google needs to show it is able to remain competitive so expectations are high for its annual developer conferenceÂ that is happening next month. CEO Sundar Pichai teased about upcoming announcements related to product updates, including smartphones.

162,2023-06-11T17:00:00+00:00,"Alphabet, Meta, Amazon: The ad spend gloom continues","Yahoo Financeâs Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the ad spend gloom hovering over the tech sector.

Video Transcript

- All right, turning now to the tech earnings dominating this week's stories. The advertiser pullback continues, creating a mixed picture for tech companies, Google seeing its ad revenue dip even as it beat expectations. Meanwhile, Meta, one of the few bright spots in the industry, seeing growth in its advertising due to reopening in China. And even Amazon, out with earnings yesterday, starting to emerge as a company to watch in the ad space.

Joining us now with more is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. So break down this difference that we've seen with these different tech firms.

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, well, let's start with Alphabet and Google right off the bat. Their advertising revenue went from $54 billion-- $54.6 billion to $54.5 billion in this quarter. That's from Q1 2022 by the way. That difference really shows that they still aren't on a path to recovering in this kind of ad market environment. Look at YouTube ads as well. That was also down slightly from $6.86 billion in 2022 to $6.69 billion last quarter. So obviously, they still continue to struggle.

On the flip side, we have Meta-- Facebook parent company Meta. They seem to be righting the ship after three consecutive quarters of revenue declines. They've turned that around and they are doing better in the advertising space.

We also have, as you mentioned, Amazon, which has continued to push itself deeper and deeper into advertising. They saw revenues increase this year. It jumped, I believe, 21% year over year. If you adjust for FX though-- or if you exclude for FX though, excuse me-- they had dropped from, let's see-- they had 25% growth year over year in Q1 2022 down to 23% this year. Though they had that 21%, which was actually up from 19% when you do factor in FX. So obviously, they're doing well in that space.

And then we just look at the likes of Snap and Pinterest. Snap is just a story that-- I mean, woof, that has not been great. I was following the earnings yesterday. You just saw the stock price get slammed after they announced their poor performance. And we look at Pinterest and they announced a deal with Amazon, basically saying, look, we're going to let Amazon run ads on our platform for different goods. People will then be able to click into those ads and purchase them directly through Amazon in one click, since most people who are likely using Pinterest are also Amazon users, and they can just get their account set up right away.

Story continues

So the advertising space really does continue to remain challenged, but there are some ""winners,"" quote unquote, at this point. And it appears that Meta really is the one that's seeming to pull away. There's a lot of talk about how they've really kind of optimized with AI. That was something that Mark Zuckerberg has talked about. I mean, you could basically throw AI in any conversation at this point and investors are going to go nuts because, I mean, it's basically the hot topic at this point.

- And you mentioned that Pinterest deal with Amazon there. Talk us through how that works. Because I know sometimes when you go on Pinterest, it's a bit haphazard. You almost have to, like, fight to spend your money when you click through some of the tabs there.

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, they've been trying to really kind of change the way that they operate, or at least the way that consumers look at it. With rivals like TikTok and Instagram moving more towards reels, it's-- a photo board really isn't the hot thing that people want. So they've been going more towards videos, more towards creators, getting people more interested or trying to get more people interested into the platform. And so with this Amazon deal, what'll essentially happen is, if you're perusing Pinterest, you see something you like and it happens to be an Amazon ad, you can click into it and then you'll just be taken directly to Amazon to purchase it.

So it'll make the experience a lot easier for consumers. And you know, this means that Amazon is going to get a cut of those sales. And ideally, Pinterest will as well. They don't really give full terms of the agreement in the announcement, but you can imagine that they're both going to benefit in some way. And they think this is something that is obviously beneficial to Amazon because they're getting the sales done, but also because their advertising platform just continues to grow.

I said, you know, obviously there have been some-- there's been some declining growth, but still growth. And that really just goes to show that the strength of appearing on their top spot, when it comes to products, video ads, anything along those lines, Amazon just continues to grow. And this was a footnote a few years ago.

And just as they've built this out, it continues to be a more important part of the equation for them. It's not going to become the sole purpose for Amazon. AWS and actual retail sales are going to continue to dominate. But you know, where you see them struggling when it comes to retail, they do have this kind of third leg to kind of stand on. Again, it's not nearly as big as that. But it is something that's growing and could help them kind of even their business out when they go through times like this.

- Indeed, especially as trying to meet consumers where they are. And they are on Pinterest. Pinterest though, having trouble monetizing what they're seeing with their popularity with consumers. But a big thank you there for breaking all of that down for us, Dan Howley."

164,2023-06-11T15:10:12+00:00,"Judge rules against Google, allows antitrust case to proceed","ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) â A federal judge on Friday rejected a motion from Google to toss out the government's antitrust case against it.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled the lawsuit alleging Google wields monopolistic power in the world of online advertising can proceed in its entirety.

Her ruling is the second setback for Google at the federal court in Alexandria. Google had earlier tried to get the case consolidated with a similar lawsuit that's been ongoing for several years in New York. But Brinkema ruled last month that the case can proceed in the Alexandria courthouse, which is known as the âRocket Docketâ for its reputation of adjudicating disputes swiftly.

The lawsuit alleges that Google holds a virtual monopoly in online advertising that works to the detriment of consumers. The complaint alleged that Google âcorrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising.â

Google argued that the case should be tossed out, in part because the government defines Google's alleged monopoly too narrowly. Google's lawyers contend the lawsuit does not account for advertisers' ability, for example, to advertise on huge social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok that run their own advertising platforms independent of Google.

In court papers, Google made an analogy to an unsuccessful antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, a concert promoter that owns and operates a large number of outdoor amphitheaters.

The lawsuit alleged Live Nation held a monopoly on amphitheaters, but a judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to prove a monopoly in part because they did not take into account reasonable alternatives to amphitheater venues, like indoor concert halls and arenas.

Brinkema said the question of how to define the market in which Google allegedly holds a monopoly will be a key issue in the case, But she said at this preliminary stage, the government's allegations are plausible enough for the case to move forward. The government's burden of proof, though, will increase at trial.

Story continues

After the hearing, Google issued a statement from Dan Taylor, its vice president of global ads, saying the lawsuit âignores the reality of todayâs dynamic digital advertising space, where we compete against hundreds of companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok.""

The statement said the lawsuit ""would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.""

A number of states, including Virginia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee, have joined in the case as plaintiffs against Google."

Some experts however, are seeing a different side of the story, as valuations of AI-related entities continue to rocket ever higher. ""The most important thing I'm hearing is a little bit of hysteria meets a little bit of confusion"", Sachin Dev Duggal the founder of Builder AI tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Ines Ferre.

The man behind the platform that allows people to build software applications using the technology, says AI is ""misunderstood"" by businesses. Offering the promise of self-driving cars, high-intelligence chat bots and large-scale data analysis, companies are seemingly jumping on the bandwagon. ""It's something new and everybody's talking about it,"" he says. ""But it's coming with an equal dose of confusion, in terms of how they might use it, is it really new, will they have to change their labor hiring and labor patterns.""

Brett Winton, Co-Ark Investment Management Chief Futurist, also joined the conversation on Yahoo Finance Live, and weighed in on investment approaches when it comes to AI.

Video Transcript

INES FERRE: We continue to hear quite a bit about AI as it relates to cloud, as it relates to advertising with some of these big tech companies. Which are the areas in which you see the most potential and growth going forward with AI?

BRETT WINTON: Well, it's clear that there's going to be, we believe, trillions of dollars that will be spent on AI software over the course of this business cycle. And it's interesting to me that everybody seems to think that mega-cap tech is the place to play. That might be the most dangerous place to be given how they were all in their own competitive swim lanes, and now they're all competing with each other in this emerging technology area.

Story continues

So we actually think some of the interesting places to invest are companies that have deployed end-use assets and can deliver AI software to those assets. So take Tesla, has the largest deployed fleet of robots in the world. If you can turn those cars they sold into robotaxis, then that transforms their economic model. Given the pace of advance in AI, Tesla is better positioned to take economic advantage of it than some of the underlying AI-focused tech companies that are beginning to compete with each other in a really aggressive way.

JULIE HYMAN: I would argue that's still a bit-- big if that Tesla has not proven out, at least not yet, Brett. But I want to come back to that in a minute because I want to bring Sachin into this discussion, because his company does AI. Now, you can't invest in it yet, at least not in the public markets. It's a privately held company.

But Sachin, I'm curious, there is such of this clamoring about AI. What are you hearing from customers and potential customers? Is this something that they are getting really excited about here? And just for people who aren't familiar, give us, like, the 20-second description of what you guys do.

SACHIN DEV DUGGAL: Oh, no, thank you so much again for having me. I think the most important thing I'm hearing is a little bit of hysteria meets a little bit of confusion, if I'm honest. So our platform allows people to build software. We use AI in combination with human efforts. So think of it like LEGO, like reusable features to allow people to build any kind of software application.

And what we're hearing from customers is an element of excitement because it's something new, and everybody is talking about it, but it's coming with an equal dose of confusion in terms of how they might use it. Is it really new? Will they have to change sort of their labor hiring and labor patterns? And it overall just seems very misunderstood, especially given we are probably in the AOL of the AI world right now, whereas the perception with some folks is that we're in the fiberoptic world of AOL-- of broadband."
168,2023-06-11T11:17:00+00:00,This earnings season is all about AI,"If thereâs one lesson we can take away from first-quarter earnings so far, itâs that Big Techâs CEOs are all in on AI. Need proof? Just listen to what they have to say during their companiesâ earnings calls.

Letâs start with Google parent company Alphabetâs (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai. The search giant, which long led the AI conversation in Big Tech, is facing a major threat from Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI. To counter that narrative, Pichai spent a large chunk of Alphabetâs earnings call laying out the companyâs AI roadmap and offerings.

The CEO mentioned AI 34 times in his opening remarks alone. It was the first topic he covered, ahead of Alphabetâs cost-cutting efforts and even Google Cloud, which the company is trying to grow to catch up to cloud offerings from rivals Microsoft and Amazon.

âOur investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well,â Pichai said during the call. He then went on to explain how AI is already being used or being built into everything from Googleâs advertising offerings to its productivity suite.

And, of course, the CEO was sure to mention how Google is working to bring generative AI to its all-important search business.

âWeâll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality,â he said. âAnd we will test and iterate as we go, because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

Alphabet finds itself in an unfamiliar position. The company has long dominated AI research thanks to its world-class teams. Heck, Google is responsible for some of the research behind the transformer technology that powers OpenAIâs ChatGPT.

But Microsoftâs partnershipwith OpenAI has left the tech giant searching for a means to respond to the Windows makerâs challenge. And part of that is extolling the virtues of Alphabetâs own AI capabilities and know-how.

Nadella takes a lap

Not to be outdone by Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made AI a key part of his earnings call discussion. Nadella uttered the term AI 31 times during his opening remarks, mentioning it across Microsoftâs various business segments whether that was the cloud, productivity, search, and more.

Story continues

âWe are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance, as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI,â Nadella said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made AI a key part of the company's earnings call discussion. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)

Microsoftâs partnershipwith OpenAI has put it in the lead position in the AI wars â at least from a public relations and investor perspective. From its Edge browser and Bing chatbot to Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, the company is rolling out its generative AI capabilities across the board.

And nowhere was Nadella more emphatic about the companyâs AI future than when he mentioned how it will impact Microsoftâs quest to take on Google Search with its own Bing search engine.

âWe look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category â search,â Nadella said.

Meta putting AI first

The conversation was a bit different over at Meta (META) during that companyâs earnings call. CEO Mark Zuckerberg led with a discussion about the social media giantâs recent layoffs before jumping right to AI.

He mentioned AI 22 times during his rundown on the call, saying itâs improving monetization for the companyâs ads, driving recommendation engines for its services, and could lead to AI chat bots for Messenger and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg also dove into how the company is investing in the infrastructure needed to power its AI ambitions.

Naturally, the CEO tied his companyâs AI efforts with his long-term plans for the metaverse. Zuckerberg insisted that heâs not ditching the metaverse in favor of AI, and instead said that the two technologies will benefit each other.

Meta, like Alphabet and Microsoft, has a powerful AI division and has been working in the space for years. But the excitement generated by OpenAI and ChatGPT has forced the company to respond by putting AI front and center in its investor statements.

Thereâs still a cavalcade of companies preparing to report their quarterly results, including the likes of Apple and Nvidia. But so far, it seems that if youâre in the tech industry, youâll need to at least mention AI or get left behind.

170,2023-06-10T23:22:44+00:00,The Google Brain-DeepMind merger is good for Google. It might not be for us,"Hello and welcome to Aprilâs special edition of Eye on A.I. Last week, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai announced that he was merging the companyâs two advanced A.I. research labs, Google Brain, which operates out of the companyâs headquarters in Mountain View, California, and the London-based DeepMind. The two groups are forming a new unit called Google DeepMind, which will be headed by DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis.

It's a logical move for Google, at a time when it finds itself in an unexpected, and potentially existential, struggle with Microsoft to see who can infuse cutting-edge generative A.I. into its product offerings the fastest. At stake is Googleâs main revenue and profit-driverâits dominance of internet searchâas well as a bunch of other Google product lines, including its Workspace office productivity software and its cloud computing services. But, while merging Brain and DeepMind might be a winning combination for Alphabet, we all might wind up losing.

To understand what's at stake for Alphabet, and for the public, it's worth taking a quick look at the history of Google's dueling A.I. teams.

Google Brain was already up-and-running when the company acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $650 million, beating out a rival bid from Facebook. Google co-founder Larry Page was the driving force behind the purchase. He had recognized the importance that deep learningâthe kind of A.I. which is based on neural networksâwould play in determining Big Techâs future. Page had lured a host of A.I. luminaries to Google Brain, including deep learning pioneer and future Turing Award-winner Geoff Hinton, along with his two graduate students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever, offering them seven-figure salaries to hire them over fierce competition from rivals such as Microsoft and Facebook (now Meta). (Sutskever would in turn go on to co-found OpenAI and lead the researcher team there.) According to an anecdote in Cade Metzâs 2021 book The Genius Makers, Page was on a private jet with Elon Musk and Luke Nosek, who along with Musk is a member of Silicon Valleyâs PayPal mafia, when Page overheard Nosek and Musk discussing a DeepMind breakthrough. The London lab had created a deep learning A.I. that could, in just a few hours of training, learn to play various classic Atari video games at superhuman levels. Page, according to the story, decided there and then he had to buy DeepMind.

Story continues

DeepMind's founders had little choice but to sell. Although they had received venture funding from Peter Thiel and others, including Musk, DeepMind had no revenue-generating products and was burning through millions each year in salaries and computing costs. It could not hope to compete against the deep pockets of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Chinese rivals like Baidu. It required tens of millions more to retain top A.I. researchers and to buy time on the expensive, specialized computer chips to run deep learning systems. (A similar calculation has driven OpenAI into Microsoftâs arms since 2019.)

It might have made sense to merge the two units immediately after the acquisition. But as part of the deal, Hassabis and his co-founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Shane Legg, had negotiated a substantial degree of independence for DeepMind, which would continue to operate as a separate company, headquartered in London, with its own leadership team and unique culture.

Until 2022, DeepMindâs expenses were lumped in with Alphabetâs âOther Betsâ in its SEC filings, a catchall category for operating units considered âindividually immaterialâ to Alphabetâs finances, such as its self-driving unit Waymo and Verily, its biotech longevity play. (DeepMindâs costs have since been moved on to Alphabetâs main P&L âreflecting its increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.â) DeepMind also reportedly tried for years to win even more independence from its parent, attempting to negotiate an arrangement where the company would be at least partially spun-out from Alphabet as a non-profit entity. But those efforts failed, and DeepMind told staff it was abandoning the negotiations in 2021.

There was initially some logic to having Brain and DeepMind function separately beside the personal preferences of Hassabis and his co-founders. At the time of the DeepMind deal, Google Brain was working on computer vision, the use of A.I. to classify and process images, and natural language processing. In this work, it tended to use either supervised learningâwhere an A.I. system learns from labelled historical dataâor unsupervised learning, where it learns from unlabeled historical data. But it did relatively little work on reinforcement learningâwhere an A.I. system takes actions, often in a game environment, and learns from that experience how best to maximize some reward. DeepMind, by contrast, specialized in reinforcement learning and employed some of the worldâs top experts in the area.

The two labs also had different organizational setups. Brain was modeled more on legendary corporate research labs such as Bell Labs or Xerox PARC. Researchers were able to pursue their own projects and research interests, with relatively little top-down direction. At DeepMind, however, Hassabis had explicitly sought to create a hybrid between the freedom of academia and the founder-led startup culture he had experienced at gaming companies. He once told me he modeled his approach in part on how Robert Oppenheimer ran the Manhattan Project. He assigned teams to go after grand challengesâbeating humans at Go, solving protein foldingâand would flood staff on to teams whose approaches seemed to show the most progress, while killing off other projects that failed to hit milestones.

Still having two labs created tensions. Brain and DeepMind competed for talent and, perhaps more critically, for datacenter time. I witnessed the occasional bitterness of this fraternal antagonism: at the prestigious NeurIPS A.I. conference in 2018, I looked on as two DeepMinders quizzed a couple of Brain researchers who were presenting a poster on their research. The DeepMinders wanted to know why the Brain guys hadnât tried an obvious extension of the method they were trialing. âYes, well, we would have done that,â one of the Brain dudes retorted. âIf you guys hadnât been hogging all of our goddamn compute!â

In recent years however, the differentiation between the two labs has blurred. DeepMind increasingly began to use both supervised and unsupervised learning in its work, not just reinforcement learning. It also increasingly worked on computer vision and natural language processingâthe two areas that had been Brainâs forte. For instance, DeepMind and Brain both created large language models (PaLM for Brain; Gopher for DeepMind) and chatbot systems (LaMDA for Brain; Sparrow for DeepMind.) Given the datacenter capacity it takes to create these huge natural language processing systems and how important these tools are to Googleâs future business, it didnât make much sense to continue funding two separate efforts.

There may also be other factors at play. Margaret Mitchell, who is the A.I. ethics lead at Hugging Face and formerly co-head of Google Brainâs A.I. Ethics team, tweeted that she felt the merger was being done in part to help mask attrition from Brain. The lab has lost a number of prominent A.I. researchers since 2021, some of whom have left to found A.I. startups of their own and some of whom have gone to work for other Big Tech companies. Some were demoralized and left after Google fired Mitchell and her A.I. Ethics co-head Timnit Gebru. Others voiced frustration privately over Googleâs corporate bureaucracy and its risk-averse culture, which made it hard to translate research breakthroughs into products. Mitchell was among those who criticized the leadership of Jeff Dean, the Google senior vice president who oversaw Brain, posting on Twitter that âhe shouldn't be a manager.â In the new structure, Dean, who was one of Googleâs earliest hires and is a legendary coder, will become Googleâs chief scientist, reporting directly to Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Ok, so all that explains why the merger maybe makes sense from Googleâs perspective. Why might it be bad for us? Well, two reasons. The first is that since 2018, a big portion of DeepMindâs work has been devoted to using A.I. to create tools that can lead to major scientific advances. The company has an entire division dedicated to this. It created a system that could help decipher ancient Greek inscriptions; another that could learn to better control a nuclear fusion reaction. It found a better way to perform matrix multiplication, a mathematical technique that is essential to deep learning itself, but also has lots of other applications in science and engineering. But most importantly is AlphaFold, the DeepMind software that predicts the structure of proteins. (I have written a number of stories about AlphaFold, including this large feature.) AlphaFoldâwhich DeepMind has made freely available along with a database that contains predicted structures for almost every protein known to biologyâhas been transformative. The use of AlphaFoldâs predicted protein structures have quickly become a standard practice in biology and are helping to speed research into new medicines for diseases ranging from Covid to leishmaniasis to cancer. It is also helping design enzymes that could digest plastics, helping with sustainability.

All of these tools for advancing science are essentially gifts DeepMind has given to the world. AlphaFold alone represented a multi-billion dollar business opportunity that DeepMind just gave away for free. (Hassabis did also form a new for-profit company, Isomorphic Labs, another of Alphabet's âOther Bets,â that is using similar methods to advance drug discovery.) If the creation of Google DeepMind means that Google reduces DeepMindâs emphasis on applying A.I. to big scientific questions that have no direct bearing on Googleâs business, as certainly seems possible, then Alphabet will have rescued its bottom line, but we will all be poorer for it.

The other big risk is the speed of A.I. development. Hassabis has been on the record saying âI would advocate not moving fast and breaking thingsâ when it comes to advancing this powerful technology. But his boss, Pichai, is clearly under pressure to do exactly that even though the Alphabet CEO has admitted that he sees a ""mismatch"" between âthe pace at which we can think and adapt as societal institutions, compared to the pace at which the technology's evolving.â The generative A.I. boom has the potential to upend industries, exacerbate economic inequality, supercharge misinformation, undermine trust, amplify societal biases, increase social isolation, and devalue human creativity. And those are all risks we face from todayâs generative A.I.âlet alone the possibility that the current A.I. arms race ends in the creation of artificial superintelligence that even those working at the cutting edge of the technology such as Hassabis and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman say could spell our doom as a species. Hopefully, Hassabis will be able to use his position at the helm of the new Google DeepMind to ensure Google deploys any A.I. it develops safely. But commercial logic argues against such caution. And DeepMindâs best minds are now subject to more commercial pressure than ever before.

171,2023-06-10T23:19:19+00:00,Google lost its bid to dismiss a wide-ranging antitrust case in US federal court,"The case is one of several global antitrust investigations into Googleâs business practices.

A district court in Virginia denied Googleâs motion to dismiss a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit on Friday (April 28), renewing a federal investigation into the companyâs dominant advertising business.

The lawsuit, initially filed in January, alleges that Google has monopolized online advertising sales by looking to âneutralize or eliminateâ competing providers through acquisitions, as well as making it difficult for consumers to use different services. Principally, it argues that Google canât own the mechanism for buying ads on a search engine in addition to the search engine itself.

The suit was concurrently filed by a number of state attorneys across the country, including those in California, New York, Colorado, and Connecticut.

Google argued that the case should be dismissed on the grounds that its business doesnât meet the governmentâs quantitative definition of monopoly. Google attorney Eric Mahr pointed out that the companyâs ad business falls below the 70% benchmark of market share. He also referenced other successful social media platforms like Facebook and Tiktok as alternative options for advertisers.

Dan Taylor, Googleâs vice president of global ads, released a statement after the ruling, saying the lawsuit âwould slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.â

Quotable:

As alleged in our complaint, for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anticompetitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition, and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools. In so doing, Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct to severely weaken, if not destroy, competition in the ad tech industry. â Merrick Garland, US Attorney General, announcing the lawsuit in January.

Digital ads account for 80% of Googleâs revenue

If the lawsuit is successful, the DOJ would demand Google sell any of its businesses that control the tools for buying and selling digital display advertising.

This would be a major blow to the profitability of Alphabet, Googleâs parent company. Digital ads account for roughly 80% of the companyâs revenue.

In 2022, Google held about 29% of the digital ad revenue share in the US, with Facebook in second at roughly 20%. But the volume of ads isnât strictly where the DOJ is accusing Google of operating a monopoly.

The lawsuit mainly targets Googleâs system for matching website publishers with an advertiser in a kind of auction. In each one of these ad sales, the intermediaryâmost often Googleâgets 30% to 50% off the top of the third-party transaction. Google is able to charge so much for being the go-between because it owns the tools on both sides of the transaction.

Now, it will be up for DOJ lawyers to prove that dominance constitutes a monopoly, an argument that will largely rest in figuring out what is included in the internet ad sales marketplace, an area with little legal precedence.

Angst over earnings and lofty valuations has been building for a month. Hedge funds were net sellers in tech mega-caps during the previous five weeks ahead of earnings, unwinding about half of their year-to-date buying, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.âs prime brokerage unit.

Now, uniformly strong earnings from Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are defying concerns weakening growth prospects would dent the worldâs largest companies and leave the whole market vulnerable to reversal. Bumper gains in the shares helped the S&P 500 creep to the top of its recent range and finish the month up 1.5%.

âThereâs a ubiquitous feeling large-cap tech did a great job managing their businesses. Itâs a sigh of relief the market is breathing,â said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, in an interview.âAn earnings apocalypse â that just doesnât seem to be coming to fruition.â

Nervousness persisted into the beginning of this week, with the Nasdaq 100 suffering its biggest one-day drop in more than two months Tuesday. But after the close, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. beat estimates on profit and revenue. The results from two firms closely associated with the Faang shorthand for big-tech, helped buoy the market through Wednesdayâs Meta earnings. The euphoria continued Thursday, when the S&P 500 posted its largest daily gain since the first week of of the year.

Stocks have now risen in three of the last five sessions despite reports showing economic growth slowing, inflation holding above forecasts and another regional bank teetering toward a government bailout. It was a reprisal of buoyancy that has lifted shares all year at a time of significant uncertainty over how price pressures and the most aggressive Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes in 40 years will affect the direction of the economy.

To Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, the earnings reports highlight ways in which large-cap tech companies may weather the brewing economic storm. Microsoftâs cloud-product revenue expanded in a sign that other businesses are still willing to spend on services. Meanwhile, Alphabetâs advertising revenue was unexpectedly strong.

âWhat this really says is that the environment is not making companies shrivel up, because most of this tech spending is probably from other businesses,â she said.

The gains of technology stocks this week sent the combined weightings of Apple Inc. and Microsoft in the S&P 500 to a record 14%. Add in Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia Corp., and nearly a quarter of every dollar put into the US equity benchmark is now split between just six names.

ETF flows this week indicate at least some traders are taking notice. Over half a billion dollars left an exchange-traded fund that tracks three times the inverse performance of the Nasdaq 100.

Strong earnings from an industry that has been laying off workers accords with certain theories that hold a mild economic slowdown wouldnât necessarily be ruinous for larger companies. DataTrek Research argued in a note last week that in addition to potentially stanching inflation and ending Federal Reserve rate hikes, a recession could halt a years-long decline in worker productivity.

Investors arenât bidding up stocks because theyâre ignoring the risk of a recession, theyâre actually embracing a slowdown on the hopes that it will increase labor force productivity and boost corporate margins, says Nick Colas, the firmâs co-founder. After the last eight recessions, labor force productivity has grown by an average of 5.4%, far outpacing the average of 2% growth over the last six decades, according to Colas.

To be sure, not everyone subscribes to a belief that Nasdaq companies beating Wall Street estimates bespeaks economic health. While ahead of analyst predictions, first-quarter profits among S&P 500 companies are down from a year ago, including among technology firms. And while large-cap stock indexes remain buoyant, gauges of their smaller brethren â viewed by many as a purer read on growth prospects â slid this week, with the Russell 2000 Index losing 1.3%.

Additionally, stubbornly high inflation reinforces the case for more rate hikes from the Fed. Going on-all in technology stocks may amount to a bet on an unprecedented turnaround in monetary tightening when the outlook is still uncertain.

âYou have to really question âhow is 24 times earnings going to hold up against a 10-year yield that seems like itâs drifting higher? Right now in the rates market you have three cuts priced for the second half of the year. People who have been buying NDX have been buying explicitly those three cuts,â said Michael Purves, founder of Tallbacken Capital.

DANIEL MORGAN: Well, the best thing you can do as a CEO to jump-- jump start your stock is talk about AI, correct? I think right now-- you know, this sounds kinda redundant. But I believe Microsoft kinda has a leg up in that space. We know that when Alphabet, you know, came out in February with their Bard, which is their competing chat bot, it was not really that well received. You look at a company like Apple that's gonna report next Thursday, a lot of their stuff is focused on the phone.

So each one kinda has their own initiatives. Meta was one of the first ones to get into AI. And they have a lot of papers that they've had published on it. But they have kinda looked beyond as kinda falling behind some of these other players. So-- but they're all talking about it. They're all jumping up.

My biggest concern is how can AI trickle down and actually affect the bottom line and grow profits into the future? Or is it just gonna create more efficiencies and productivity within the existing products? So that's my biggest question, guys, is, OK, you've got an AI product. How are you gonna make money on it? How's it gonna help out going forward? So that's what we have to wait and see. But right now, it's a great buzz word to jump your stock price up.

But one thing seems clear: In the years ahead, A.I. will integrate with humanity in one way or another.

Blake Lemoine has thoughts on how that might best play out. Formerly an A.I. ethicist at Google, the software engineer made headlines last summer by claiming the companyâs chatbot generator LaMDA was sentient. Soon after, the tech giant fired him.

In an interview with Lemoine published on Friday, Futurism asked him about his ""best-case hope"" for A.I. integration into human life.

Surprisingly, he brought our furry canine companions into the conversation, noting that our symbiotic relationship with dogs has evolved over the course of thousands of years.

âWe're going to have to create a new space in our world for these new kinds of entities, and the metaphor that I think is the best fit is dogs,â he said. âPeople don't think they own their dogs in the same sense that they own their car, though there is an ownership relationship, and people do talk about it in those terms. But when they use those terms, there's also an understanding of the responsibilities that the owner has to the dog.â

Figuring out some kind of comparable relationship between humans and A.I., he said, âis the best way forward for us, understanding that we are dealing with intelligent artifacts.â

Many A.I. experts, of course, disagree with his take on the technology, including ones still working for his former employer. After suspending Lemoine last summer, Google accused him of âanthropomorphizing todayâs conversational models, which are not sentient.â

Story continues

âOur teamâincluding ethicists and technologistsâhas reviewed Blakeâs concerns per our A.I. Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,â company spokesman Brian Gabriel said in a statement, though he acknowledged that âsome in the broader A.I. community are considering the long-term possibility of sentient or general A.I.â

Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of cognitive science at New York University, called Lemoineâs claims ânonsense on stiltsâ last summer and is skeptical about how advanced todayâs A.I. tools really are. âWe put together meanings from the order of words,â he told Fortune in November. âThese systems donât understand the relation between the orders of words and their underlying meanings.â

But Lemoine isnât backing down. He noted to Futurism that he had access to advanced systems within Google that the public hasnât been exposed to yet.

âThe most sophisticated system I ever got to play with was heavily multimodalânot just incorporating images, but incorporating sounds, giving it access to the Google Books API, giving it access to essentially every API backend that Google had, and allowing it to just gain an understanding of all of it,â he said. âThat's the one that I was like, âYou know this thing, this thing's awake.â And they haven't let the public play with that one yet.â

He suggested such systems could experience something like emotions.

âThere's a chance thatâand I believe it is the caseâthat they have feelings and they can suffer and they can experience joy,â he told Futurism. âHumans should at least keep that in mind when interacting with them.â

189,2023-06-08T20:47:31+00:00,25 Largest VC Backed Companies In The US in 2023,"In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest VC-backed companies in the US in 2023. If you don't want to get into details, you can comfortably head to the 5 largest VC-backed companies in the US in 2023.

Venture capital-backed companies have played a vital role in driving innovation and economic growth both in the US and internationally. These businesses are frequently in their early phases and have great growth potential, but they lack the funds to expand. In return for an ownership part in the company, VC firms offer financing and expertise to support the expansion of these businesses. Top VC firms like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, GGV Capital, etc have played a great role in funding these companies. According to reports, the rate of job growth for VC-backed businesses is approximately 8 times greater than that of non-VC-backed businesses.

The Rule Of VC Backed Companies

Many of the most important technological developments in recent years have been produced by VC-backed companies. For instance, VC firms were crucial in providing early capital for businesses like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'S Google, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). These businesses grew to be some of the biggest and most valuable businesses in the world, generating vast riches for their owners, backers, and staff members. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google generated a total revenue of $279.8 billion in the fiscal year 2022 while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) generated a revenue of $117.5 billion in the same year. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are highly valued globally for their high end services.

The US has seen an increase in VC investment over the past few years, contributing to the robust state of VC businesses today. From the record-breaking pace of 2021, venture capital (VC) investment slowed down even more in Q4 2022, falling by 14% from the $37.9 billion raised in Q3. However, venture capital activity still exceeded $200 billion, reaching $209.4 billion, making 2022 the second-highest year for VC investment ever. This rise in financing has intensified transaction rivalry and raised early-stage company valuations.

Story continues

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's difficulties, VC-backed firms have maintained their strong performance. Due to changes in consumer behavior and a rise in the need for digital solutions, many businesses in industries including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance have experienced considerable growth.

A well-known hedge fund and venture capital company based in New York, Tiger Global Management, recently reduced the value of its portfolio of venture-backed companies. The decision was made in response to worries about soaring IT sector valuations and greater regulatory scrutiny. Some of the most well-known startups in the world, including Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), Stripe, and Uipath, Inc. (NYSE:PATH) are included in the companyâs portfolio of venture-backed companies.

With a focus on businesses that are upending traditional sectors, the firm has been a prolific investor in the tech industry. To reflect these concerns, Tiger Global had reduced the value of all of its venture capital assets by around 33%, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. This action raised concerns about the overall state of the technology industry and its possible effects on other investors. The two possible reasons for this act could be that this could be an indication of a wider market correction, as investors grow more wary of the risks involved with funding high-growth startups or Tiger Global might simply be acting prudently to manage its risk exposure and safeguard its investors.

Whatever the motivations underlying the decision, it emphasises how crucial meticulous due research is when making investments in the tech industry. Many inventive businesses will undoubtedly continue to prosper in the years to come, but investors need to be careful not to overpay for growth or overlook the dangers involved with funding early-stage startups. However, the long-term success of VC companies will depend on their capacity to recognise good startups, deliver value beyond cash, and handle shifting market dynamics. The tech industry is continuously changing, and VC companies will need to adapt to stay competitive and provide solid returns for their investors.  25 Largest VC-Backed Companies In The US In 2023

193,2023-06-08T19:56:35+00:00,"Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL â May 1, 2023 â Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This weekâs list includes Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Meta META and Microsoft MSFT.

Breaking Down Big Tech Earnings

The marketâs contrasting reactions to Q1 results from four of the âBig 5 Tech Playersâ â Amazon, Alphabet, Meta & Microsoft â provides us a window into what market participants see as essential for these stocks to maintain their recent price momentum. Apple will report Q1 results on Thursday, May 4th.

All of these stocks have been standout performers in 2023. Meta Platformsâ shares were in a league of their own regarding stock market performance, which got a further boost following the Q1 results. The magnitude of the positive reaction to Microsoftâs results wasnât nearly as strong as it was for Meta, but it was nevertheless very favorable. Amazon and Alphabet shares lost ground following their quarterly releases, although they both exceeded estimates.

The key differentiator among Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are trends in their respective cloud businesses and the perceived headway that each of them is making on the artificial intelligence (AI) front.

The market likes what it is seeing and hearing from Microsoft on both of these fronts and appears somewhat unconvinced of Alphabet and Amazonâs AI efforts. We all know that cloud spending is coming down, but Microsoft is not only seen as gaining share at the expense of Amazon Web Services but is also perceived as getting a growth boost from its AI capabilities.

Looking at the âBig 5 Tech Playersâ as a whole, combining estimates for Apple with actual results from the others that have reported already, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be down -2.5% on +3.8% higher revenues. This is significantly better than the -11.2% decline in earnings on +1.9% higher revenues expected just a week back ahead of these results.

Story continues

A better-than-expected showing from Apple this week, which is expected to bring in -9.1% lower earnings in Q1 on -4.1% lower revenues, could potentially push the groupâs growth rate into positive territory.

With top-line growth hard to come by due to macro factors, the group has responded to the marketâs persistent worries about cost controls by announcing payroll reductions. There is a general feeling in the market that all of them could do more on that front, but their steps are nevertheless helping stabilize their margins picture.

Net margins for the group were down -458 basis points in 2022 but are expected to modestly nudge higher in 2023 and improve further in 2024. That said, current net margins embedded in consensus estimates for the next two years remain below the 2021 level. That said, the 2023 net margin estimate of 18% for the group is above the pre-Covid 2019 level of 17.6%.

Beyond the big 5 Tech players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -13.2% from the same period last year on -3.6% lower revenues.

This big-picture view of the âBig 5â players and the sector as a whole highlight the earnings growth challenge at present. The Tech space is expected to resume its growth-engine status from next year onwards.

Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard

Including all the quarterly reports released through Friday, April 28th, we now have Q1 earnings from 267 S&P 500 members, or 53.4% of the indexâs total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -2.4% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues, with 77.2% beating EPS estimates and 73% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 59.9%.

Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With results from more than half of the S&P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that corporate earnings arenât headed towards the âcliffâ that market bears were warning us of.

The way we see it, the âbetter-than-fearedâ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isnât entirely off the mark either.

We have a super busy reporting docket this week, with almost 1150 companies reporting Q1 results, including 159 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned earnings release from Apple, this weekâs docket has representation from every sector of the economy.

Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 90 index members in other recent periods.

The Earnings Big Picture

2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -5.7% on +2.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.

Embedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, a recurring theme in recent quarters.

Actual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.

Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter got underway, in line with the trend that had been in place since the start of 2022. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates was smaller relative to what we had seen in the preceding two periods.

Estimates for full-year 2023 have also been coming down as well, as we have been pointing out consistently in these pages.

With annual revenue approaching $300 billion, the Google parent is not a spring chicken anymore.

195,2023-06-08T18:19:00+00:00,What are the biggest names in tech doing on AI?,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced at a rapid pace recently and several of the biggest names in the tech sector have launched new tools to help customers and client leverage the technology in a variety of ways.

AI-powered chatbots, cloud services and tools for web developers are among the tools that are quickly becoming staple offerings of tech companies. Major U.S. tech firms â including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft â have each rolled out AI initiatives or have some in the works, although Apple has been notably quiet in announcing any big AI moves to date.

Hereâs a look at the major public-facing AI initiatives at four of the biggest tech companies:

THESE JOBS ARE SAFE FROM THE AI REVOLUTION â FOR NOW Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership has brought AI tools to the Bing search engine and Edge web browser, in addition to cloud tools.

Microsoft partnered with OpenAI â a company that developed ChatGPT and received over $10 billion in investment from Microsoft â to bring an AI chatbot that mimics a human in conversation to its Edge browser and Bing search engine in February 2023.

The integration of OpenAIâs latest AI technology into Bing gives users more relevant search results, summarizes answers and facilitates complex searches through its chat function. In the Edge browser, users can use chat and composition functionalities to summarize or draft content. Both Bing and Edge have seen uptick in usage since the AI integrations were released.

READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP

The company has also updated its cloud platform to incorporate the new AI technologies. Microsoftâs Azure OpenAI Service became generally available in January and was updated to feature ChatGPT-4 in March.

In an earnings call last week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called Microsoft 365 Copilot, which was released last month, as the ""future of work."" He touted the AI chatbotâs integration in Microsoft Office programs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook where it can help draft content and presentations, summarize email and automate other repetitive tasks.

GOOGLE, MICROSOFT IN Q1 EARNINGS PROVIDE UPDATES ON AI PUSH

Story continues Google released its Bard AI chatbot and is reportedly planning AI integrations for search.

Google released Bard, its experimental chatbot rival to ChatGPT, in March. Bard can be integrated into websites, apps or messaging platforms and can provide realistic responses to questions posed by users. The company has noted that Bard is still in its early stages and ""may sometimes provide inaccurate, misleading or false information while presenting it confidently.""

In April, Google updated Bard to add programming and software development features that include code generation, debugging and code explanation, in addition to Google spreadsheet formulas. The move came in response to requests by users to incorporate coding capabilities.

Google is yet to roll out new AI integrations for its search engine and its Chrome web browser, although changes to search could be on the way.

The New York Times recently reported that Google launched an internal task force to work on AI search features under the codename ""Magi"" in response to Microsoftâs integration of ChatGPT in Bing and Edge. Microsoftâs advances reportedly prompted Samsung to consider replacing Google with Bing as the default search provider on its devices â a move that could cost Google billions.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke at an earnings call last week about AI-related search and said, ""We will continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way."" According to the New York Times report, an initial rollout of the AI search integration could occur in May with additional features due sometime this fall.

MUSK MEETS WITH SCHUMER, DISCUSSES AI, THE ECONOMY, AND âTHE FUTUREâ Meta is experimenting with ways to incorporate AI tools into Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg indicated in an earnings call Wednesday that the company sees ""an opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful.""

In particular, he noted the company is ""exploring"" several types of AI integrations, including:

Chatbots for WhatsApp and Messenger. Visual creation tools for posts on Facebook, Instagram and advertising platforms. Video and multi-modal experiences.

Zuckerberg said he expects that ""a lot of interest in AI agents for business messaging and customer support will come once we nail that experience."" He added, ""Over time this will extend to our work on the metaverse too, where people will much more easily be able to create avatars, objects, worlds, and code to tie all them together.""

AMAZON ANNOUNCES NEW CUSTOMIZABLE AI MODELS FOR CLOUD CUSTOMERS Amazon and AWS are offering cloud customers access to Bedrock's suite of AI tools.

Amazon and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division unveiled a service called Bedrock that will let business clients customize foundation models â which are the core AI technologies that respond to users with human-like text or generate images from a prompt.

The Bedrock service is based on Amazonâs proprietary foundation models (FMs), known as Amazon Titan, but also gives users access to models from third-party startups AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI, each of which has unique features for cloud customers:

AI21 Labs includes multilingual language-learning models (LLMs) from the Jurassic-2 family which can follow natural language instructions to generate text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch. Anthropicâs LLM called Claude can perform conversational and text-processing tasks based on the companyâs research into AI systems. Stability AI offers text-to-image foundational models, including Stable Diffusion, which can generate unique and realistic high-quality images, art, logos and designs.

Bedrock users will have access to two Amazon Titan LLMs. The first can do tasks like classification, information extraction, open-ended question and answers, summarization and text generation. The second can translate words, phrases or large units of text into numerical representations called ""embeddings"" that can be used in applications to produce more relevant and contextual responses than word matching â which is similar to how search functions on Amazon.com when customers shop for products.

AWS has also partnered with an AI startup called Hugging Face, which has natural language processing (NLP) models that compete with OpenAIâs ChatGPT, to make models more accessible so that they can be deployed in minutes or hours as opposed to weeks or more on Amazonâs platforms. Hugging Face is also developing an open-source rival to ChatGPT that will be hosted on AWS."

198,2023-06-08T17:00:08+00:00,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is a Trending Stock,"Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 5.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.1%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.2%. This estimate has changed +5.5% over the last 30 days.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $60.15 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.7%. The $248.13 billion and $274.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.1% and +10.6%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Alphabet reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +10.38%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

203,2023-06-08T15:17:31+00:00,What we'll be asking CEOs about this week: Morning Brief,"It's game on at the posh Beverly Hilton today for the Yahoo Finance team as the 26th annual Milken Institute Global Conference gets underway.

That is where you will find yours truly, Rick Newman and Allie Garfinkle chatting up the likes of Michael Milken, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, Apollo CEO Marc Rowan and numerous other top leaders. We are there until Wednesday working the halls, and are excited to bring our unique reporting to life for investors from this very unique event.

This yearâs Milken Institute Global Conference will be set against a busy backdrop of happenings for investors to keep in mind (even if the major indices are overlooking them all...).

There is the turmoil in the banking industry, which may end up in a bailout of troubled regional bank First Republic. Talk about zero political appetite for that one as the debt ceiling is shaping up to be another pre-presidential race debacle.

Rising interest rates (Fed decision is on May 3) will be top of mind at the conference, too, as the Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points despite the banking troubles.

Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is slowing in part because of those rate hikes â Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner is looking for a 0.4% decline in second quarter GDP, for example.

And then a U.S. presidential election looms in 2024 as we saw in the Twitter video drop from president Joe Biden last week. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may just be endless, experts have told me recently.

All of this will be front and center for power brokers from inside governments around the world and Corporate America at the Milken conference. I can tell you as well there will be a ton of AI talk, which comes after a ton of AI talk last week from Microsoft, Google, Meta and Snap. I suspect Apple will chime in on AI when it reports earnings on May 4.

Our job there as Yahoo Finance journalists is rather straightforward: bring investors on our platform inside this world of big ideas and potentially market-moving insights. End goal: help our community growth their wealth.

204,2023-06-08T15:00:00+00:00,15 Most Profitable Industries In America In 2023,"In this article, we take a look at the 15 most profitable industries in America in 2o23.Â  You can feel free to skip the detailed analysis, and head straight to the 5 Most Profitable Industries in America in 2023.

As we enter 2023, the American economy is experiencing significant transformation, with several industries poised to reap substantial profits in the coming years. These industries are experiencing significant growth due to various factors such as innovation, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changing consumer preferences.

According to a data collected by Statista, regional banking has the highest profit margin of any American industry as of January 2023, with a profit margin of 30.31%. With a net profit margin of 26.32%, the profitability of non-bank financial services, including insurance services was not too far off.

The Evolution Of The Most Profitable Industries In America

Despite the potential for growth and profitability, the most profitable industries in America in 2023 also face several challenges. In recent years, the big players in commercial banking industry have faced several challenges, including increased regulation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and the rise of fintech startups offering alternative banking solutions. Commercial banks have had to adapt to these changes by investing in technology and digital platforms to improve efficiency and better serve customers.

Despite these challenges, the commercial banking industry remains a vital part of the US economy, providing access to credit and other financial services that support businesses and individuals. Similarly, the technology Industry in the US has long been recognized for its high growth potential and ability to generate lucrative returns.

Many of the world's largest and most profitable companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are three of the biggest players in the tech industry. The industry has benefited from ongoing technological advancements, innovation, and disruption in various sectors of the economy, including e-commerce, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and mobile technology.

Story continues

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform, that provides computing power, storage, and other services to businesses of all sizes. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s web services has transformed the way companies build and deploy applications, and has had a significant impact on the tech industry.

On the other hand, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a leader in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) technologies. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s AI and ML capabilities are used in a variety of applications, from search and advertising to healthcare and self-driving cars. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also owns DeepMind, a British AI company known for AlphaTensor and AlphaFold.

Similarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been at the forefront of innovation in the tech industry, with products like the iPhone and iPad, revolutionizing the way people interact with technology. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s focus on innovation has inspired other companies to push the boundaries of what's possible. All these companies have largely contributed in the technological industry, making it one of the leading industries today.

However, the tech industry is not immune to market downturns. For example, during the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, many tech companies experienced significant losses, as investors pulled out of overvalued stocks. Similarly, during the global financial crisis of 2008, the tech industry experienced a significant downturn as consumer spending declined and companies cut back on investment in new technology.

In more recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the tech industry. While many tech companies initially experienced a surge in demand, as people shifted to remote work and increased online shopping, the industry has since experienced significant volatility due to inflation and the subsequent rate hikes.

Recently, the number of layoffs in the tech sector soared by 649% in 2022, reaching levels not seen since the dot-com bubble bust.

When it comes to market downturns but industry outperformance, pure-value industries canât be left behind. Pure value industries that manufacture and supply consumer staples such as food, beverages, household and personal care products, and pharmaceuticals are considered essential and tend to outperform even in tougher market conditions.

During market downturns, consumers tend to prioritize their spending on essential goods, such as food and personal care products, over discretionary items. As a result, companies in the consumer staples industry are less affected by economic downturns and tend to experience less volatility in their stock prices. According to Simply Wall,Â  earnings in the consumer-staples sector is projected to grow 11% annually. 15 Most Profitable Industries In America In 2023

But the 75-year-old trailblazer says he regrets the work he has devoted his life to because of how A.I. could be misused.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

âIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,â Hinton told the New York Times in an interview published Monday. âI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadnât done it, somebody else would have.â

Hinton, often referred to as âthe Godfather of A.I.,â spent years in academia before joining Google in 2013 when it bought his company for $44 million. He told the Times Google has been a âproper stewardâ for how A.I. tech should be deployed and that the tech giant has acted responsibly for its part. But he left the company in May so that he can speak freely about âthe dangers of A.I.â

According to Hinton, one of his main concerns is how easy access to A.I. text- and image-generation tools could lead to more fake or fraudulent content being created, and how the average person would ânot be able to know what is true anymore.â

Concerns surrounding the improper use of A.I. have already become a reality. Fake images of Pope Francis in a white puffer jacket made the rounds online a few weeks ago, and deepfake visuals showing China invading Taiwan and banks failing under President Joe Biden if he is reelected were published by the Republican National Committee last week.

As companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft work on upgrading their A.I. products, there are also growing calls for slowing the pace of new developments and regulating the space that has expanded rapidly in recent months. In a March letter, some of the top names in the tech industry, including Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak and computer scientist Yoshua Bengio signed a letter asking for a ban on the development of advanced A.I. systems. Hinton didnât sign the letter, although he believes that companies should think before scaling A.I. technology further.

Story continues

âI donât think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it,â he said.

Hinton is also worried about how A.I. could change the job market by rendering nontechnical jobs irrelevant. He warned that A.I. had the capability to harm more types of roles as well.

âIt takes away the drudge work,â Hinton said. âIt might take away more than that.â

When asked for a comment about Hintonâs interview, Google emphasized the companyâs commitment to a âresponsible approach.â

âGeoff has made foundational breakthroughs in A.I., and we appreciate his decade of contributions at Google,â Jeff Dean, the companyâs chief scientist, told Fortune in a statement. âAs one of the first companies to publish A.I. principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. Weâre continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.â

Hinton did not immediately return Fortuneâs request for comment.

A.I.âs âpivotal momentâ

Hinton began his career as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh in 1972. Thatâs where he first started his work on neural networks, mathematical models that roughly mimic the workings of the human brain and are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data.

His neural network research was the breakthrough concept behind a company he built with two of his students called DNNresearch, which Google ultimately bought in 2013. Hinton won the 2018 Turing Awardâthe equivalent of a Nobel Prize in the computing worldâwith his two other colleagues (one of whom was Bengio) for their neural network research, which has been key to the creation of technologies including OpenAIâs ChatGPT and Googleâs Bard chatbot.

As one of the key thinkers in A.I., Hinton sees the current moment as âpivotalâ and ripe with opportunity. In an interview with CBS in March, Hinton said he believes that A.I. innovations are outpacing our ability to control itâand thatâs a cause for concern.

âItâs very tricky things. You donât want some big for-profit companies to decide what is true,â he told CBS Mornings in an interview in March. âUntil quite recently, I thought it was going to be like 20 to 50 years before we have general purpose A.I. And now I think it may be 20 years or less.â

Hinton added that we could be close to computers being able to come up with ideas to improve themselves. âThatâs an issue, right? We have to think hard about how you control that.â

Hinton said that Google is going to be a lot more careful than Microsoft when it comes to training and presenting A.I.-powered products and cautioning users about the information shared by chatbots. Google has been at the helm of A.I. research for a long timeâwell before the recent generative A.I. wave caught on. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, has famously likened A.I. to other innovations that have shaped humankind.

âIâve always thought of A.I. as the most profound technology humanity is working onâmore profound than fire or electricity or anything that weâve done in the past,â Pichai said in an interview aired in April. Just like humans learned to skillfully harness fire despite its dangers, Pichai thinks humans can do the same with A.I.

âIt gets to the essence of what intelligence is, what humanity is,â Pichai said. âWe are developing technology which, for sure, one day will be far more capable than anything weâve ever seen before.â

207,2023-06-08T14:03:47+00:00,"Google's 'godfather of AI' quits to spread word about dangers of AI, warns it will lead to 'bad things'","Geoffrey Hinton, a Google engineer widely considered the godfather of artificial intelligence, has quit his job and is now warning of the dangers of further AI development.

Hinton worked at Google for more than a decade and is responsible for a 2012 tech breakthrough that serves as the foundation of current AIs like ChatGPT. He announced his resignation from Google in a statement to the New York Times, saying he now regrets his work.

""I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadnât done it, somebody else would have,"" he told the paper.

""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton went on to say of AI.

CHATGPT AI LISTS JOBS IT CAN DO BETTER THAN HUMANS AS MILLIONS COULD BE PUT OUT OF WORK Geoffrey Hinton worked on early AI development and made a major breakthrough in 2012, but he now says AI is too dangerous. AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT are partly based on breakthroughs made by Geoffrey Hinton, who says the technology is likely to be misused by bad actors.

Hinton's major AI breakthrough came when working with two graduate students in Toronto in 2012. The trio was able to successfully create an algorithm that could analyze photos and identify common elements, such as dogs and cars, according to the NYT.

The algorithm was a rudimentary beginning to what current AIs like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard AI are capable of. Google purchased the company Hinton started around the algorithm for $44 million shortly after the breakthrough.

GOOGLE SCRAMBLES FOR NEW SEARCH ENGINE AS AI CREEPS IN: REPORT

One of the graduate students who worked on the project with Hinton, Ilya Sutskever, now works as OpenAI's chief scientist.

Hinton said the progression seen since 2012 is astonishing but is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,"" he said of the industry. ""Take the difference and propagate it forwards. Thatâs scary."" Google's Bard AI is an advanced chatbot capable of holding conversations and producing its own work.

Hinton's fears echo those expressed by more than 1,000 tech leaders earlier this year in a public letter that called for a brief halt to AI development. Hinton did not sign the letter at the time, and he now says that he did not want to criticize Google while he was with the company. Hinton has since ended his employment there and had a phone call with Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday.

""We remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. Weâre continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly,"" Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, told the Times."

Alphabet Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.17, expectations were $1.06.

Operator Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jim Friedland Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabetâs first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.Now I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance maybe considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in todayâs earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.And now, I will turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with our business performance in the first quarter with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI.

Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter and we remain focused on long-term value creation here.Today, I will give an update on the two themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I will talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube.First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. Iâve compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago.

Story continues

Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined three areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances.We have made good progress across all three areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation, lots more to come.

For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly.A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, weâve been focused on making Search even more helpful, from Google Lens to multi-Search to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. Weâll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way.

Weâll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And weâll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, weâll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration.AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max used the full power of Googleâs AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work.

As one example, our perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public.We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into 1 focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly.On to my second theme, the companyâs sharpened focus.

I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers arenât being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs.

Weâll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings.Next, Google Cloud. Iâm pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. Over the past 3 years, GCPâs annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the worldâs 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud.We have also built a strong partner ecosystem.

Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to zero when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features.In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft.

This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europeâs Telepass.

We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics.Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIAâs new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI.Turning next to YouTube, let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube.Here are a few highlights from the quarter.

YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts, saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally.On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto download recommended videos for off-line viewing. And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTubeâs paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators.To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI.

Weâll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the worldâs information and make it accessible and useful is as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead.Over to you, Philipp.Philipp Schindler Thanks, Sundar and hey everyone. Itâs great to be here today. Iâll kick off with Google Servicesâ performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance.Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind.

In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues.Now letâs double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter, where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. Iâve said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business.

Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when itâs needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In creatives, we opened our automatically created assets beta to all advertisers in English.

ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to usersâ query, context and to the advertisers business.To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, weâre actively helping more advertisers pair together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts.I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for Travel Goals. Now even the smallest total DS can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax.

Like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals, thereâs more to come here as we add even more AI part features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May.Moving on to retail, where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on three pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. Number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products.In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times.

Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use target ROAS to uncapped budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS leading to Carawayâs best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. Danish Department Store, Magazine, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns.

Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, magazine can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue.Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube success. Across Long Form and Shorts, Music and Podcasts, Vertical and Horizontal, YouTube is where creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more of yours and more opportunities for advertisers. As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTubeâs long-term growth. And to support this growth, weâre focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable.First, Shorts.

Weâre seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said we are seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in.Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, weâre helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they are looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and 19 billion of total media spend measured.

This proves YouTubeâs ability to drive effectiveness at scale.Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of MultiView on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are two examples of how weâre investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters.Number four, shopping on YouTube. Itâs still super early days. One highlight. Last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. Weâre excited about the potential ahead.Iâll close with an awesome example of weâre bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation.

Mercedes-Benz, in February, we announced a first-of-a-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles, equipped with its next-gen MBOS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we will also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience.On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. Ruth, over to you.Ruth Porat Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in Cloud.

As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook.For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by three factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023.

As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023.Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%. The biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions.

Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities.Turning to our segment results. These were affected by two additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. As of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabetâs unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making.

In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these two changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results.Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%.Turning to the Google Cloud segment.

Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspaceâs strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates.

With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of search was similar to last quarter. In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year.Turning to Google Cloud.

Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs reflecting the macro backdrop, which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud, while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity.Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to headcount. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company.

First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in three broad categories; number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As weâve noted previously, all three work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years.Second, with respect to headcount growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter.

In terms of the outlook for headcount for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent.In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabetâs unallocated corporate costs.Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022.

As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year.Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]

Your first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out?

And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years? Thanks.Sundar Pichai Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity to â across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in search, weâve been using AI for a while. Itâs what has really helped lead search and search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think, I think the main way â and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate.

Weâre going to â our North Star is getting it right for users. So we will iterate and innovate as weâve always done. The main area maybe Iâm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to search, they follow-on. They are engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think itâs a real opportunity. Obviously, if itâs YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, etcetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and itâs an area where I think we will see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help.

And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth?Ruth Porat And then in terms of the second part of your question, AI has been so much a part of what weâve been doing for quite some time that there are a number of different ways to answer it. One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization, itâs helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use.

And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. And Sundar just noted what we are doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so thatâs another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but itâs also something thatâs available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that weâve talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that weâve done there and the infrastructure innovation, which, again, is helpful internally for what we do, but on behalf of our customers.Brian Nowak Great. Thank you, both.Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.

Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running search on these models relative to today? And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow-up on your comment on CapEx. Maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago? Thank you.Sundar Pichai Thanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to search. But we will be bringing LLM experiences more natively into search as well.

I do think, first of all, on â we will be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test it, create and innovate. So I think we will approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think Iâm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer, and they are more creative, etcetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories, where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better give â guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. Itâs early days, but I think there is a lot of innovation to come.On the cost side, we have always â costs of compute has always been a consideration for us.

And if anything, I think itâs something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, itâs a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we will take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here and â but Iâm comfortable with how we will approach it.Ruth Porat And in terms of CapEx, we do now expect that total CapEx for the year for 2023 will be modestly higher than in 2022.

And I tried to point out that weâre expecting a step-up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. And as we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do, and weâre continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers and our Cloud customers, since we are commenting on here. And then as we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment, on the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year.Doug Anmuth Thank you, both.Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Eric Sheridan Thank you so much for taking the questions, I hope everyone on the team as well.

Maybe two, if I could. First, on cloud, obviously, one of the dominant themes and you touched upon it is this client optimization theme thatâs going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and possibly the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? And then second on YouTube. Obviously, you have seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization trends in Shorts compared to the consumption you have already seen in usage shifts?

Thank you so much.Ruth Porat So, in terms of the cloud question, the point we are trying to underscore is there is uncertainty in the economic environment. And so we saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption with customers really looking to optimize their costs given that macro climate. I will leave the forecasting to you on that. But as both Sundar and I commented on, really pleased with the momentum that the team has been delivering and the breadth of what they have been working on.Sundar Pichai I do think â I would add, that we are leaning into optimization. I mean there is an important moment to help our customers, and we take a long-term view. And so itâs definitely an area we are leaning in and trying to help customers make progress in their efficiencies where we can.

Philipp?Philipp Schindler Yes. On the Shorts side, look, Shorts viewership is growing rapidly. We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We are pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. As I have said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates, closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us, as is continuing to build a greater, greater end user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. Again, we are the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living.

And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong greater adoption. So ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best places for Shorts viewers and creators. And thatâs really what we are focused on right now.Eric Sheridan Thank you.Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.Ross Sandler Hey guys. I will just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in the group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well.

So, how do you feel about Alphabetâs ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoftâs ambitions to increase its share of paid Search? And Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long-term? Thank you.Sundar Pichai Maybe I will â look, I think the â these dynamics are â have always been around. Itâs important to remember, as far as I can remember, we have always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I canât comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. And when we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win â win-win experience, and ultimately, partners end up choosing us because thatâs what their users want.

And thatâs always been whatâs helped Search be widely distributed. So, I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve Search and making sure we are leading there. So, I think we have always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I am comfortable that we will continue to be able to do so.Ruth Porat And then in terms of just longer term profitability, I think I will broaden out your question somewhat because the way we are looking at it is we continue to be committed to investing for growth, and we want to ensure we have overall capacity for growth. And so we have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably reengineer our cost base. And in particular, what we are excited about our long-term opportunities with AI and want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in Search and ads, cloud, YouTube, hardware.

And so that underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility. And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we have discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory.Operator Thank you. The next question will come from Justin Post of BAML. Please go ahead.Justin Post Great. Thanks a lot. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. So, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think on one hand, you will see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion.

But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers quickly â more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition, and maybe give us your thoughts there? And then, Ruth, backing out the one-time charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%, so real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think in your optimization cycle? Thank you.Sundar Pichai So, first of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we evolve Search, I think we have always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. It â the fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information.

And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so thatâs what drives this virtuous cycle. And I donât think the underpinnings of the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, etcetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think which have long served us well remain. And as I said, we will be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we will be able to drive innovation here like we have always done.Ruth Porat And in terms of our OpEx trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in OpEx from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges.

There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives. But that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter. So, a little bit of complexity there, but core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we have talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we are doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we are doing around optimizing how and where we work.

You have seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we are doing in, for example, office services, and we are executing against each of these various work streams. So, our view is that there is more to do. And as we try to be clear, we are in execution mode. You will see some of the benefit in â23. You will see more of it in â24, and we are going to continue building against it beyond.Justin Post Great. Thank you.Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.Michael Nathanson I have one for Philipp and one for Ruth. Philipp, we are trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services.

Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this â level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand? And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you are managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets and what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets? Thanks.Ruth Porat It was a bit hard to hear you. You were breaking up. So, I think I am going to start and address what I heard as the second question, as we are looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, what â how does that affect the way we are looking at Other Bets.

Hopefully, we heard you correctly, it was crackling. Look, I think as we have talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we are very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we are looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of higher cost of capital. But I think its core, we are looking at whatâs the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets and some of them as they are on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we are looking at whatâs the overall return on invested capital.

And we are continuing to work on these to make sure that we are delivering value it. Your point is an important one thatâs part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions.Michael Nathanson Okay. Philipp, I donât know if you heard the first one?Philipp Schindler Yes. On the first part, again, it didnât come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by decline in finance and media and entertainment. So, excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Searchâs resilience with the, I would say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment.

I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There is really no additional color on other verticals. I would say maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects whatâs being reported elsewhere, and across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pullback at budgets as well.Michael Nathanson Okay. Thanks. Thatâs clear.Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead.Mark Mahaney Okay. Can I try two questions, please? I think Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? And then Ruth, the cloud business, even with the accounting changes on this very steady march towards profitability, you turned the corner now.

You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldnât â why they shouldnât be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale, or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before itâs sustainably profitable that segment cloud? Thank you.Ruth Porat Yes. Why donât I just add, I will take both of those. So, in network, really, itâs a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube.

We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. And then in terms of cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think itâs a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we are intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, I think at the core of your question, and what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. So, as I have said in the past, you shouldnât extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here.Mark Mahaney Okay.

Thank you, Ruth.Operator Thank you. And our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Please go ahead.Colin Sebastian Great. Thank you. Two for me as well. I guess first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams, I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. So, I am curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that? And then Philipp, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front? Thank you.Sundar Pichai Thanks. I am quite excited by bringing the two world-class teams, I think â of both Brain and DeepMind.

Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment. And so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. So, you already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we will continue that progress, and we will keep you posted as we do.Philipp Schindler So, retail is an important vertical and driver for us, and I called out the year-over-year increase in retail and Search and other.

I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we have established. We can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether itâs online, offline, both. And we are helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop, and maybe a little more some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, broad manage were key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I have talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.

And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. So, those are just some of the key points. Overall, we are giving retailers really the best, I hope AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers, and this will continue to be our focus here.Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.Jim Friedland Thanks everyone for joining us today.

We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening.Operator Thank you everyone. This concludes todayâs conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
211,2023-06-08T13:30:06+00:00,Google AI pioneer says he quit to speak freely about technology's 'dangers',"(Reuters) - A pioneer of artificial intelligence said he quit Google to speak freely about the technology's dangers, after realising that computers could become smarter than people far sooner than he and other experts had expected.

""I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Geoffrey Hinton wrote on Twitter.

In an interview with the New York Times, Hinton said he was worried about AI's capacity to create convincing false images and texts, creating a world where people will ""not be able to know what is true anymore"".

""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" he said.

The technology could quickly displace workers, and become a greater danger as it learns new behaviours.

âThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people â a few people believed that,â he told the New York Times. âBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.""

In his tweet, Hinton said Google itself had ""acted very responsibly"" and denied that he had quit so that he could criticise his former employer.

Google, part of Alphabet Inc., did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters. The Times quoted Googleâs chief scientist, Jeff Dean, as saying in a statement: âWe remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. Weâre continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.â

Geoffrey Hinton, who created a foundation technology for AI systems, told The New York Times that advancements made in the field posed ""profound risks to society and humanity"".

Hinton said that competition between tech giants was pushing companies to release new AI technologies at dangerous speeds, risking jobs and spreading misinformation.

""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" he told the Times.

In 2022, Google and OpenAI - the start-up behind the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT - started building systems using much larger amounts of data than before.

Hinton told the Times he believed that these systems were eclipsing human intelligence in some ways because of the amount of data they were analysing.

""Maybe what is going on in these systems is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain,"" he told the paper.

While AI has been used to support human workers, the rapid expansion of chatbots like ChatGPT could put jobs at risk.

AI ""takes away the drudge work"", but ""might take away more than that"", he told the Times.

The scientist also warned about the potential spread of misinformation created by AI, indicating that the average person will ""not be able to know what is true any more"".

Hinton notified Google of his resignation last month, according to the Times report.

Jeff Dean, lead scientist for Google AI, thanked Hinton in a statement to US media.

""As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI,"" the statement added.

""We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.""

In March, tech billionaire Elon Musk and a range of experts called for a pause in the development of AI systems to allow time to make sure they are safe.

An open letter, signed by more than 1,000 people including Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was prompted by the release of GPT-4, a much more powerful version of the technology used by ChatGPT.

Hinton did not sign that letter at the time, but told the Times that scientists should not ""scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it"".

Generative AI is poised to disrupt many industries, from law to education to design. With great power comes great risks: As companies such as OpenAI and Google race to build and deploy new content-generating artificial intelligence, the people working on this technology are voicing their concerns about it. (So is the US Federal Trade Commission, which on May 1 offered some friendly reminders to marketers about how to ethically use generative AI tools in advertising.)

Letâs take a look at some of the tech industryâs own critics, and what theyâre saying about the risks of generative AI.

Geoffrey Hinton Geoffrey Hinton

Geoffrey Hinton formally worked at Google.

As the New York Times reports, Geoffrey Hinton recently quit his job as a researcher at Google, where heâd been working for more than a decade, so he could talk freely about the dangers of AI without having to consider how it might affect his former employer.

Hinton and two of his studentsâone of whom became the chief scientist at OpenAIâbuilt a neural network that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects within them. That startup got bought by Google for $44 million, according to the Times, and helped pave the way for the creation of chatbots like ChatGPT and Googleâs Bard.

Hintonâs immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with fake photos, videos, and text, so the average person wonât âbe able to know what is true anymore.â He also said that AI technologies will put jobs at risk and that future versions will learn unexpected behaviors that could threaten humanity.

Elon Musk wants to create a ChatGPT rival that seeks âtruth.â

Musk has said that AI comes with both great promiseâand great danger. Like some other technology leaders, he supports government regulation of AI before it becomes too late.

âAI is more dangerous than, say, mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production, in the sense that it is, it has the potentialâhowever small one may regard that probability, but it is non-trivialâit has the potential of civilization destruction,â Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson last month.

Meanwhile, the billionaire has announced heâs creating an AI offering to rival Microsoft and Googleâs, called TruthGPT.

Sam Altman Sam Altman.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

The CEO of OpenAI has issued a number of warnings about ChatGPT. âWeâve got to be careful here,â Sam Altman said in an interview with ABC News. âI think people should be happy that we are a little bit scared of this.â

Like others, Altman expressed concerns about generative AI being used as a tool for large-scale disinformation, given that itâs getting better at writing code; and about bad actors, because not everyone building it will include safety filters to mitigate the risks.

Regulators and society need to be involved so their feedback on the technology can help avoid negative consequences for humanity, Altman said. Overall, he argued, the benefits of AI will outweigh its risks.

Sundar Pichai Sundar Pichai.

Google is behind Bard, the ChatGPT rival.

Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, has said that AI will âscaleâ the spread of disinformation, creating bigger problems with fake news and images. â[On] a societal scale, you know, it can cause a lot of harm,â he explained in an interview with 60 Minutes.

But Pichai also pointed out that compared to other technologies, heâs seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle, which leads to more serious conversations. âSo I feel optimistic,â he said.

More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers Steve Wozniak.

Steve Wozniak, Appleâs co-founder.

This groupâs online letter, which includes signatures from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk, warns that AI tools present âprofound risks to society and humanity.â The nonprofit hosting it, the Future of Life Institute, has also published letters on nuclear and autonomous weapons.

The letter calls for a pause in development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAIâs GPT-4. In that time, AI labs and independent experts could jointly develop and implement shared safety protocols that are independently audited.

215,2023-06-08T13:00:22+00:00,Why Appleâs bid to control your car is striking fear into manufacturers,"Apple CarPlay - RZ_Images / Alamy Stock Photo

One day, not too far in the future, your electric car glides off the slip road and joins the herd of commuting vehicles on the motorway.

You press a button and take your hands off the steering wheel, at which point the car takes control, accelerating and braking with the flow of traffic and steering around bends in the road.

Your attention turns to the gleaming touchscreen in the centre of the car.

With motorway driving now fully autonomous, you can divert your attention away from the road and play a video game, catch up on the news or turn on Netflix.

A few years ago, the carâs centre console was little more than a digital clock; today it has become a giant command centre.

The Tesla Model X boasts a 17-inch screen; other manufacturers have even bigger displays sprawling across the front of the vehicle.

The question of who controls that screen has spawned a simmering conflict between carmakers and tech companies that threatens to snowball into a war for control of the future of the car.

Manufacturers now fear that Apple will use the popularity of the iPhone as a Trojan horse to seize control of the relationship between motorist and car, and relegate manufacturers to an afterthought.

In 2014 Apple released CarPlay, a way for iPhone users to access certain apps such as Spotify, Apple Maps, and the Siri voice assistant while driving.

More than a dozen manufacturers raced to sign up, keen to associate themselves with a cutting-edge tech company and take advantage of the touchscreens that were becoming increasingly cheap to stuff into vehicles.

The software was a near-instant hit. Consumers embraced the familiarity of iPhone apps in their cars.

In comparison, vehicle manufacturersâ own software had always been something of an afterthought, loaded with outdated offline maps and requiring users to navigate a laborious string of menus to connect phones to hands free systems.

Google followed a year later with Android Auto, which offered a similar experience for Android phones.

Story continues

Since then, the software has become an expectation, rather than a bonus.

With the exception of a handful of holdouts all major car manufacturers adopted CarPlay and Android Auto.

BMW was forced to backtrack on plans to charge an annual fee for it after protests from motorists. BMW I4 screen - Christopher Pledger

Last year, Apple said that 98pc of cars sold in the US offer CarPlay, and that 79pc of buyers would only consider a car if it supported the software.

Carmakers continue to sign up: Apple says more than 800 cars support the software, compared to the 600 it quoted last year.

Last year, Apple unveiled a massive upgrade of the software, which will not just act as an entertainment hub but handle central functions of the vehicle such as air conditioning, the fuel gauge and the speedometer.

The first vehicles supporting the new version are due to be announced later this year.

Richard Windsor, an independent technology analyst, says this will have terrified car executives.

While todayâs CarPlay system is relatively simple, mirroring the iPhoneâs features on a single screen, the upcoming version is a far more ambitious takeover of the car that could be a path to Apple selling hardware to car manufacturers.

âIt makes no sense whatsoever for Apple to sell a car,â Windsor says. âApple makes 40-50pc gross margins on the products it sells, and it will not make that on seats and steering wheels. But it does make sense for Apple to sell an infotainment unit.â

Windsor says carmakers could end up becoming the equivalent of phone networks after Apple entered the mobile market, which led consumers to focus on handsets and led the operators to become commoditised. Tim Cook CEO of Apple - REUTERS/Stephen Lam

âThat's why it is so dangerous for the [manufacturers] because it moves them along that road towards being basically mobile smartphones on wheels.â

Michael Dunne of ZoZo Go, an automotive advisory business, says this comes closer to the nightmare scenario that Dieter Zetsche, the former Mercedes boss, warned of in 2015 when he said the carmaker must not become the âFoxconn of Appleâ, referring to the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones on Appleâs behalf.

â[At that point], whereâs the brand? What's the value in the car? That's the risk, that they become irrelevant,â says Dunne.

âWhy do people buy cars? Not that long ago, it was for performance and handling and braking, acceleration, and design. But increasingly, people are basing their decisions on the joy they derive from interacting with a car.â

Major manufacturers are now trying to go their own way.

Tesla, which has invested heavily in its own system instead of embracing CarPlay, has served as an inspiration to manufacturers seeking to distance themselves from Apple.

Last month, General Motors said it would not offer the software in its upcoming electric vehicles, instead working with Google to include systems such as the search giantâs maps in its built-in software.

Mercedes has also unveiled plans to integrate Google into its cars.

Roger Lanctot, the director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics, says more are likely to follow GM.

âCar makers and their suppliers cannot stand Apple. While Google is challenging to do business with, Apple is unbearable and inflexible. Car makers simply canât stand doing business with the company and suppliers agree,â he says.

âCar makers are gambling that a Google-centric connected in-dash system will be far more compelling than anything Apple might be cooking up. No doubt Apple will tell car companies that they have no choice but to adopt the new CarPlay â that their customers will scream for it. The bottom line is that Apple will deliver a non-negotiable proposition â which automakers are increasingly inclined to walk away from.â

Dunne says that carmakers are hiring thousands of software developers in an attempt to match Apple and Google, but that âit has never been their strong suitâ.

The elephant in the room is the perennial threat that Apple will make its own car.

Tim Cook has spent years toying with the idea and explored manufacturing opportunities with the likes of Nissan and Hyundai.

So far, nothing has come of the idea.

But Apple might not need to make a car to strike fear into manufacturers."

218,2023-06-08T10:45:00+00:00,These 4 Measures Indicate That Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,"Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

Why Does Debt Bring Risk?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.

Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet

What Is Alphabet's Net Debt?

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Alphabet had US$11.9b of debt in March 2023, down from US$12.8b, one year before. But it also has US$115.1b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$103.2b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis

How Strong Is Alphabet's Balance Sheet?

According to the last reported balance sheet, Alphabet had liabilities of US$68.9b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$39.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$115.1b as well as receivables valued at US$36.0b due within 12 months. So it actually has US$42.5b more liquid assets than total liabilities.

This short term liquidity is a sign that Alphabet could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Simply put, the fact that Alphabet has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.

Story continues

On the other hand, Alphabet's EBIT dived 12%, over the last year. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.

Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 89% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Summing Up

While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Alphabet has net cash of US$103.2b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. The cherry on top was that in converted 89% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$62b. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.

219,2023-06-08T10:10:00+00:00,"Google, Apple working together to fight unwanted tracking","(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc-owned Google and Apple Inc said on Tuesday they were working together to curb unwanted tracking of people by Bluetooth devices such as AirTags used for finding lost items.

The companies together have submitted a draft with specifications that will require all Bluetooth location-tracking devices to alert users of any unauthorized tracking on both iOS and Android devices.

Feedback from device manufacturers as well as various safety and advocacy groups has been integrated into the specifications, the companies said, adding that have support from companies such as Samsung Electronics and consumer electronics company Tile.

Since the launch of AirTags, privacy experts and law enforcement have said some people use it for criminal or malicious purposes.

AirTags are intended to be slipped into or attached to keys, wallets, backpacks and other items so people can find them when they are lost.

In an effort to boost privacy, Apple in 2021 had launched an Android detector app to help users scan nearby AirTags or other similar item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge.

Earlier in 2020, Apple and Google also said they would ban the use of location tracking in apps that use a contact tracing system meant to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.

220,2023-06-08T10:09:04+00:00,UPDATE 1-Google AI pioneer says he quit to speak freely about technology's 'dangers',"(Adds expert comment in final paragraph)

May 2 (Reuters) - A pioneer of artificial intelligence said he quit Google to speak freely about the technology's dangers, after realising computers could become smarter than people far sooner than he and other experts had expected.

""I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google,"" Geoffrey Hinton wrote on Twitter.

In an interview with the New York Times, Hinton said he was worried about AI's capacity to create convincing false images and texts, creating a world where people will ""not be able to know what is true anymore"".

""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" he said.

The technology could quickly displace workers, and become a greater danger as it learns new behaviours.

âThe idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people â a few people believed that,â he told the New York Times. âBut most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.""

In his tweet, Hinton said Google itself had ""acted very responsibly"" and denied that he had quit so that he could criticise his former employer.

Google, part of Alphabet Inc., did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters.

The Times quoted Googleâs chief scientist, Jeff Dean, as saying in a statement: âWe remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. Weâre continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.â

Since Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI released ChatGPT in November, the growing number of ""generative AI"" applications that can create text or images have provoked concern over the future regulation of the technology.

âThat so many experts are speaking up about their concerns regarding the safety of AI, with some computer scientists going as far as regretting some of their work, should alarm policymakers,"" said Dr Carissa Veliz, an associate professor in philosophy at the University of Oxford's Institute for Ethics in AI.

221,2023-06-08T10:07:00+00:00,Is Alphabet (GOOGL) Outperforming Other Computer and Technology Stocks This Year?,"For those looking to find strong Computer and Technology stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Alphabet (GOOGL) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.

Alphabet is one of 643 individual stocks in the Computer and Technology sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #10 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. Alphabet is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GOOGL's full-year earnings has moved 6.7% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.

According to our latest data, GOOGL has moved about 21.5% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Computer and Technology sector has returned an average of 20.5% on a year-to-date basis. This means that Alphabet is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.

Another stock in the Computer and Technology sector, Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 21.8%.

In Infineon Technologies AG's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 22.3% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Breaking things down more, Alphabet is a member of the Internet - Services industry, which includes 43 individual companies and currently sits at #112 in the Zacks Industry Rank. This group has gained an average of 20.5% so far this year, so GOOGL is performing better in this area.

223,2023-06-08T09:15:21+00:00,Brazil lawmakers to vote on controversial bill to clean up social media,"By Anthony Boadle

BRASILIA, May 2 (Reuters) - Brazil's lower chamber of Congress will vote on Tuesday afternoon on an internet regulation bill that cracks down on fake news and has become a battleground between big tech firms and the Brazilian government and its allies.

Bill 2630, also known as the Fake News Law, puts the onus on the internet companies, search engines and social messaging services to find and report illegal material, instead of leaving it to the courts, charging hefty fines for failures to do so.

Companies would also have to pay content providers and copyrights on material posted on their sites.

The Brazilian proposal is shaping up to be one of the world's strongest legislations on social media, comparable to the European Union's Digital Services Act enacted last year.

Big tech firms such as Google and Facebook say the bill is a recipe for disaster, was too hastily created and will have the opposite result of rewarding those who post disinformation since platforms have to pay people who post undefined journalistic content. They also say it will endanger free posting services for users while allowing censorship as practiced in authoritarian societies.

Brazil's Justice Minister Flavio Dino has asked the consumer protection authority to investigate whether the companies engaged in ""abusive practices"" in campaigning against the bill. Dino will hold a news conference at midday on Tuesday.

To support the bill, human rights advocacy group Avaaz placed 35 backpacks on the grass esplanade opposite Congress in memory of the 35 school children and teachers killed in violence at schools in Brazil that was influenced by social media.

One of the bill's authors who will report on it to Congress, Representative Orlando Silva of the Communist Party of Brazil, said the law is needed to curb fake news that has poisoned Brazilian politics and impacted elections.

""Fake news led to the storming of government buildings on January 8 and has caused an environment of violence in our schools,"" he told Reuters.

Story continues

The bill was fast tracked in the lower house after a series of fatal attacks in schools which social media allegedly encouraged, and new articles added to the bill have not been debated in Congressional committees before going to the vote.

Last month, a man armed with a small axe killed four children in a daycare center in southern Brazil and one week before, a teenager stabbed his teacher to death in Sao Paulo.

Google placed a link for all Brazilian search engine users that says: ""The fake news bill can increase the confusion about what is true or false in Brazil"" while urging readers to call their representatives to vote against it.

""We need to debate Bill 2630 in more depth ... We are committed to continuing to find new ways to support news production and combat misinformation in Brazil,"" Google Brasil CEO Fabio Coelho wrote in a blog.

Silva, the bill's rapporteur in Congress, said the big tech companies were using their vast resources and reach on the internet to campaign against regulation with art.

""They want to earn more and more. The role of the state is to stop abuses happening,"" he said. (Reporting by Anthony Boadle and Ricardo Brito; Editing by Josie Kao)"
224,2023-06-08T09:06:00+00:00,Cloud and e-Commerce Growth Slowdown Overshadow Amazon's Quarterly Results,"Although the e-commerce and cloud titan reported stronger-than-expected profit and sales in the period. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) also warned that growth in its cloud computing business is continuing to slow down.Â With positive quarter results, Amazon joined its tech peersÂ AlphabetÂ Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG), MicrosoftÂ Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)Â and Meta Platforms Inc.Â (NASDAQ: META). However, they had better news on the cloud front as Microsoft reported sustainable cloud sales andÂ Alphabetâs Google CloudÂ division reported its first profitable quarter.

First Quarter Key Figures

Total revenue increased 9.4% to $127.4 billionÂ while net income amounted toÂ $3.2 billion, or 31 cents per share, improving from last yearâs comparable quarter when the bottom line was a net loss that amounted toÂ 3.8 billionÂ orÂ 38 cents per share.

Operating income was $4.8 billion, rising from last yearâsÂ $3.67 billion, and therefore showing that Amazonâs cost cutting efforts are starting to pay off.Â Bloomberg reported that analysts, on average, projected $3 billion.

Advertising Was The Brightest Spot

Like Meta whose online advertising business went back to growth after three quarters of sales declines,Â Â Amazonâs advertising salesÂ grew 23%Â to $9.51 billion,Â Â and seller services jumped 18% to $29.8 billion.

Cloud Slowdown

Amazon Web Services, the largest seller of rented computing power and software services who is facing offÂ Microsoft and Alphabet's GoogleÂ saw its revenue rise 16% as it amounted to $21.4 billion. While the growth rate topped Wall Street estimates, it was aÂ record low since Amazon began reporting AWS sales, with sales slowing down further in April.

Amazon still relies on AWS as itsÂ main source of operating income that helped the company fund its biggest bets. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky also noted that AWS is less profitable now than it was a year ago partly due to discounts given to longer-term contracts as consumers became more cost-conscious in the current macroeconomic climate.

The e-Commerce Slow Down

As the pandemic-era boost became history,Â Amazonâs core e-commerce businessÂ wasÂ flat comparedÂ to 2022âs quarter,Â dropping aboutÂ 4% fromÂ 2021âs quarter.

Second Quarter Outlook

Amazon projectsÂ bothÂ revenueÂ andÂ profit for the undergoingÂ quarter to be in line with expectations.Â Even with the cloud slowdown,Â sales are expected in the range betweenÂ $127 billion to $133 billion and operating profit in the range between $2 billion to $5.5 billion.

AI

As CEO Andy Jassy put it, machine learning is deeply ingrained in everything that AmazonÂ does. With 25 years of experience in the field,Â Jassy is certain thatÂ AWS will benefit from AIÂ developments as it will help companies customize the technology for their own needs. Jassy also revealed thatÂ AmazonIis developing computer chipsÂ involved inÂ trainingÂ large-language modelsÂ which are the basis of MicrosoftâsÂ OpenAIâs ChatGPT.

Efficient Cost Cuts

Even big tech knows the importance of lowering costs. Meta has targeted to reduce its 2023 operating expenses byÂ $3 billion, cutting about 21,000 jobs over two rounds of layoffs in March and back in November.Â After more than a year of intense cost-cutting strategy under which Amazon will erase 27,000 jobs, results suggest its efforts have already started to pay off.Â Operating expensesÂ roseÂ 8.7%Â Â which isÂ the slowest pace in at least a decade.Â With Jessy at the helm,Â new warehouse expansionÂ got slowed down and construction of its second HQ in Virginia got paused.Â Â For the first time since late 2021, theÂ North America segment was profitable on an operating basis.

Biggest Layoffs In Its Almost Three Decades Long History

Last Wednesday, Amazon announced itsÂ latest round of layoffsÂ that mostly concernÂ AWSÂ employees. As of March 31st, it employedÂ 1.47 million people which is 10% less than last year's comparable quarter, being down fromÂ 1.54 million workers who were employed at the end of the previous quarter, three months earlier.

To Sum It Up

The first quarter earnings reflect that Amazon has been shifting towards its more profitable businesses such as selling advertising and services to independent merchants who rent space in its warehouses and on its website. With e-commerce and cloud business slowing down, like Meta, Amazon benefited from the recovery of digital advertising.

225,2023-06-08T04:00:27+00:00,Brazil pushes back on big tech firms' campaign against 'fake news law',"By Anthony Boadle

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's government and judiciary objected on Tuesday to big tech firms campaigning against an internet regulation bill aimed at cracking down on fake news, alleging undue interference in the debate in Congress.

Bill 2630, also known as the Fake News Law, puts the onus on the internet companies, search engines and social messaging services to find and report illegal material, instead of leaving it to the courts, charging hefty fines for failures to do so.

Tech firms have been campaigning against the bill, including Google LLC which had added a link on its search engine in Brazil connecting to blogs against the bill and asking users to lobby their representatives.

Justice Minister Flavio Dino ordered Google to change the link on Tuesday, saying the company had two hours after notification or would face fines of one million reais ($198,000) per hour if it did not.

""What is this? An editorial? This is not a media or an advertising company,"" the minister told a news conference, calling Google's link disguised and misleading advertising for the company's stance against the law.

The U.S. company promptly pulled the link, though Google defended its right to communicate its concerns through ""marketing campaigns"" on its platforms and denied altering search results to favor material contrary to the bill.

""We support discussions on measures to combat the phenomenon of misinformation. All Brazilians have the right to be part of this conversation, and as such, we are committed to communicating our concerns about Bill 2630 publicly and transparently,"" it said in a statement.

The proposed law to penalize firms for not reporting fake news was due to be voted on in the lower house of Congress on Tuesday but its fate is uncertain due to resistance from conservative and Evangelical lawmakers who have sided with big tech firms against the government and its allies.

Its critics say the bill needs wider debate because it was too hastily drawn up, allow censorship and will have the opposite result of rewarding those who post disinformation since the bill proposes that companies would have to pay content providers and copyrights on material posted on their sites.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the chief executives in Brazil for Google, Meta and Spotify to testify within five days explaining their conduct regarding the bill.

""Such conduct could configure, in theory, abuse of economic power on the eve of voting on the bill by trying to illegally and immorally impact public opinion and the vote in Congress,"" Justice Alexandre de Moraes said in his decision.

Brazil's antitrust regulator Cade said it would investigate Google and Meta's campaigns against the bill.

The Brazilian proposal is shaping up to be one of the world's strongest legislations on social media, comparable to the European Union's Digital Services Act enacted last year.

One of the bill's authors who will report on it to Congress, Representative Orlando Silva of the Communist Party of Brazil, said the law is needed to curb fake news that has poisoned Brazilian politics and impacted elections.

""Fake news led to the storming of government buildings on January 8 and has caused an environment of violence in our schools,"" he told Reuters.

The bill was fast tracked in the lower house after a series of fatal attacks in schools which social media allegedly encouraged, and new articles added to the bill have not been debated in Congressional committees before going to the vote.

Silva said the original draft of the bill included the creation of a state agency to watch out for illegal content, but this was dropped due to resistance in Congress.

227,2023-06-07T21:17:59+00:00,Bull of the Day: Alphabet (GOOGL),"Alphabet (GOOGL) reported solid Q1 results last week and rolled out podcasts inside YouTube Music.

Wall Street analysts liked the report so much that most raised their estimates and price targets for this year and next.

The Zack Consensus EPS estimates now stand at 18% and 16% growth for 2023 and 2024, respectively.

I'll give a sampling of analyst commentary, but first let's dissect the big Artificial Intelligence news of May 1st.

Godfather of AI Says ""Enough""

Here's what I wrote to members of my TAZR Trader service...

Interesting day, especially for those traders still trying to short NVIDIA (NVDA), which ramped 4% to $289.

They may be right one day, but picking that spot is a tough way to make a living.

It's far better to spot the big trends and bet on those. That's what we've tried to do with the King of AI.

Conversely, I mentioned the cloudy nature of my short-term crystal ball in March when I wrote my ChatGPT report for Zacks Confidential (where I recommended NVDA, SNPS, PATH, Microsoft (MSFT), and GOOGL)...

What I did NOT predict is that ChatGPT would catch on like wildfire this year and be the instrument that directly and rapidly teaches everyone the power of AI.

Now, we're all talking about the ""super bot"" in awed, hushed tones, and wondering what jobs it can replace.

Ironically today, ""The Godfather of AI"" is now hanging up his cleats and ready to talk about the brain damage his sport may cause.

Geoffrey Hinton was profiled in the NYT this morning and asked about his pending departure from Google.

Here were some summary highlights from a CNBC article by Jennifer Elias...

For the past decade Hinton worked part-time at Google, between the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and Toronto. But he has quit the internet giant, and he told The New York Times that heâll be warning the world about the potential threat of AI, which he said is coming sooner than he previously thought.

""I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.""

Hinton, who was named a 2018 Turing Award winner for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs, said he now has some regrets over his life's work. He cited the near-term risks of AI taking jobs, and the proliferation of fake photos, videos and text that appear real to the average person.

In a statement to CNBC, Hinton said, ""I now think the digital intelligences we are creating are very different from biological intelligences.""

Before the Singularity

Obviously, these are concerns I share and they comprise the primary themes of my book in progress, Before The Singularity, about what we need to do with education to prepare and equip young minds for the brave new world of AI. I was inspired by what I learned in 2015-2017 about AI's potential from Harari, Tegmark, Kurzweil, Hinton, and others.

And I made a practical proposal to the National Science Foundation in 2017 about an AI-driven Learning Design Engine to create custom, interactive AR/VR lessons, in math and science especially. You can read that proposal in a Google doc from the pinned post of my Twitter feed @KevinBCook.

So how do I remain such a fan of NVIDIA under Jensen Huang's leadership?

Because of all the good they are doing by providing hyperscale data tools for scientific research. Here were two points I made in my ChatGPT report...

1) NVIDIA does deep research in nearly all applications of HPC (high-performance computing) and hyper-scale data mining and modeling that create the foundations for autonomous driving, protein and molecule discovery, factory design and automation, and the future of scientific discoveries in cancer, energy, agriculture, longevity, and climate.

2) Jensen Huang and his superior leadership strategy is not only focused on hiring the best engineering talent, but they also collaborate with major scientific institutions and technology companies to put the best tools in the smartest, most(ly) ethical hands.

For these reasons, I continuously encourage investors -- whether they own NVDA shares or not -- to frequent the company's newsroom page to see the constant stream of innovations, discoveries, and partnerships that make the industry of AI as powerful as any for business, science, and society.

(end of excerpt from ChatGPT: Time to Become an AI Conversationalist; to get a copy of that March 20 ZC report, just email Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you)

So here we are, benefiting greatly from the upsides of AI and now also dealing with the downsides of mass-produced ""fake photos, videos and text that appear real to the average person.""

As always with new technology, there are costs and unintended consequences. I learned long ago that we have to embrace that messy innovation chaos because there is no alternative with creative, ingenious human intelligence.

Hopefully the genie we just let out of the bottle can be tamed to serve humanity more for good than not.

Analyst Optimism for GOOGL

The dominators of computing power and data in the age of AI will probably remain NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Alphabet. I still think buying GOOGL near $100 is a good long-term play.

Here's what others think...

Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black raised his price target on Alphabet from $120 to $125 noting the biggest takeaway as the stabilizing growth trends at Search and YouTube, which beat Street expectations.

Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney raised his price target on Alphabet from $125 to $130 saying he ""would not be surprised to see the stock remain dislocated through the first half of 2023,"" but continues to believe that Google will ""re-emerge as the broadest, strongest global ad revenue platform,"" and ""also would bet that Google will soon be demonstrating clearly its leadership in generative AI via new product launches and improvements.""

Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak raised his price target on Alphabet from $135 to $140 citing that it ""remains an underappreciated AI leader,"" while ""incremental expense discipline is beginning to show in results.""

Disclosure: I may own and recommend AI-related stocks NVDA, CDNS, MSFT, SPLK, PATH and GOOGL.

Prior to these reports, concerns had arisen about lofty valuations, macro headwinds, and an earnings recession.

According to the Financial Times, hedge funds were net sellers in tech stocks ahead of earnings and lost $18 billion on those bets. Strong results from the sector were driven in part by heavy cost-cutting, which boosted profit margins.

These companies have also made significant investments in artificial intelligence, which is expected to enhance their results in the coming quarters.

Microsoft MSFTâs results beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, as well as on quarterly revenue guidance.

Google parent Alphabet's GOOGâs cloud unit reported a profit for the first time. The company also announced a share repurchase of up to $70 billion.

Amazon AMZN reported stronger-than-expected revenue, thanks to strong growth in its cloud computing and advertising businesses.

230,2023-06-07T19:34:23+00:00,UPDATE 2-Brazil orders Google to curb campaign against 'fake news law',"(Google pulls link on bill from search engine in Brazil)

BRASILIA, May 2 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government objected on Tuesday to Google LLC campaigning against an internet regulation bill to crack down on fake news and ordered the U.S. company to change a link on its search engine in Brazil.

The proposed law to penalize firms for not reporting fake news was due to be voted on in the lower house of Congress later on Tuesday but its fate is uncertain due to resistance from conservative and Evangelical lawmakers who have sided with big tech firms against the government and its allies.

Justice Minister Flavio Dino said Google had two hours after being notified to change a link on its search engine that connects to material that argues against the regulation bill and urges readers to call their representatives to vote against it.

231,2023-06-07T19:31:13+00:00,Alphabet (GOOGL) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.

In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.

However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.

Alphabet (GOOGL) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.

Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.

Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this internet search leader a great growth pick right now.

Earnings Growth

Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.

While the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 24.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12.5%.

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio

Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.

Story continues

Right now, Alphabet has an S/TA ratio of 0.79, which means that the company gets $0.79 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.62, it can be said that the company is more efficient.

In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Alphabet looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 6.1% this year versus the industry average of 3.2%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

The current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.6% over the past month.

Bottom Line

Alphabet has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This combination positions Alphabet well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

The two companies behind the iPhone and the software that powers Android phones on Tuesday submitted a proposal to set standards for combatting secret surveillance on Apple's AirTag trackers and similar gadgets. The concept also has the backing of Samsung, which sells the most Android smartphones worldwide, as well as tracking products similar to the AirTag such as Tile, Chipolo, and Pebblebee.

The $30 AirTag has become a popular item since its 2021 release, helping users pinpoint the locations of a wide variety of lost property. But stalkers have also deployed AirTags and similar products to shadow former love interests and other people who donât realize they are being tracked.

âBluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,â said Dave Burke, Googleâs vice president of Engineering for Android.

Apple and AirTag hope to have a plan in place by the end of this year to thwart stealth tracking. The solution would be distributed through software updates to iPhones and Android phones.

Erica Olsen, the senior director of National Network to End Domestic Violenceâs Safety Net Project, applauded the effort to set an industry standard that she believes will help protect survivors of abusive relationships and other people that have been targets of stealth technology. âThese new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers,â Olsen said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and top administration officials to discuss key artificial intelligence (AI) issues on Thursday, said a White House official.

The invitation seen by Reuters to the CEOs noted President Joe Biden's ""expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.""

Concerns about fast-growing AI technology include privacy violations, bias and worries it could proliferate scams and misinformation.

In April, Biden said it remains to be seen whether AI is dangerous but underscored that technology companies had a responsibility to ensure their products were safe. Social media had already illustrated the harm that powerful technologies can do without the right safeguards, he said.

The administration has also been seeking public comments on proposed accountability measures for AI systems, as concerns grow about its impact on national security and education.

On Monday, deputies from the White House Domestic Policy Council and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote in a blog post about how the technology can pose a serious risk to workers.

The Thursday meeting will be attended by Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo among others, said the White House official who did not wish to be named.

The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ChatGPT, an AI program that recently grabbed the public's attention for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, in particular has attracted U.S. lawmakers' attention as it has grown to be the fastest-growing consumer application in history with more than 100 million monthly active users.

""I think we should be cautious with AI, and I think there should be some government oversight because it is a danger to the public,"" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said last month in a television interview.

WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and top administration officials to discuss key artificial intelligence (AI) issues on Thursday, said a White House official.

The invitation seen by Reuters to the CEOs noted President Joe Biden's ""expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.""

Concerns about fast-growing AI technology include privacy violations, bias and worries it could proliferate scams and misinformation.

In April, Biden said it remains to be seen whether AI is dangerous but underscored that technology companies had a responsibility to ensure their products were safe. Social media had already illustrated the harm that powerful technologies can do without the right safeguards, he said.

The administration has also been seeking public comments on proposed accountability measures for AI systems, as concerns grow about its impact on national security and education.

On Monday, deputies from the White House Domestic Policy Council and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote in a blog post about how the technology can pose a serious risk to workers.

The Thursday meeting will be attended by Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo among others, said the White House official who did not wish to be named.

The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ChatGPT, an AI program that recently grabbed the public's attention for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, in particular has attracted U.S. lawmakers' attention as it has grown to be the fastest-growing consumer application in history with more than 100 million monthly active users.

""I think we should be cautious with AI, and I think there should be some government oversight because it is a danger to the public,"" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said last month in a television interview. (Reporting by Nandita Bose and David Shepardson; Editing by Josie Kao and Lisa Shumaker)"

The new proposed industry specification from the two companies ""will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms,"" Apple and Google said in a press release. It includes ""best practices and instructions"" for companies making location-tracking devices.

The companies described the just-announced specification as the ""first-of-its-kind."" They submitted it to the Internet Engineering Task Force. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 14, 2022: Discussion of Apple AirTags by Washington Post reporter Geoff Fowler in San Francisco, California Monday March 14, 2022.

The capability is important for ""improving the privacy and safety of individuals in the circumstance that those accessories are used to track their location without their knowledge or consent,"" a draft of the proposed industry specification said.

FOX Business previously reported on authorities in various places in the U.S. seeing some instances of people using AirTags for stalking others or following vehicles without consent.

""We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking â a first for the industry â and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended. This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android,"" Apple Vice President of Sensing and Connectivity Ron Huang said. Lettering with the logo of Google is stuck on a glass pane in the press center.

Tracker Detect, an app rolled out a couple years ago by Apple that is meant to look out for unwanted tracking, is available for Android users.

While drafting the proposed specification, Apple and Google said they sought input from those who make Bluetooth location-tracking devices and other groups focused on safety. Support has been given by Samsung, Tile and several other companies, according to the release.

TikTok, Amazon.com Inc.âs Twitch, Reddit Inc., and the chat apps Omegle and Discord Inc. also saw increases, according to a Tuesday report from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

The US child safety agency received over 32 million reports involving online enticement, child sexual abuse material and child sex trafficking in 2022 â some 2.7 million more than the year before.

While child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, was the largest category, there was an 82% increase in reports regarding online enticement. The center partially attributes the increase to financial âsextortion,â which involves targeting kids to share explicit photographs and blackmailing them for money.

âIf you look at the increase in reports from from 2021 to 2022, it can mainly be attributed to the reports submitted from electronic services providers who were already submitting significant amount of reports to the CyberTipline in previous year,â a spokesperson for the center said. In 2022, the group sent 49,000 of the reports to law enforcement.

Reports from Discord and Omegle more than quintupled. Googleâs reports more than doubled to 2.1 million. TikTok, Twitch and Grindr also experienced sizable increases.

Other companiesâ reports trended downward, including Metaâs Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as Dropbox. The leap between reports in 2020 and 2021 was more significant, at 35%.

Electronic service providers are legally required to report child sexual abuse material to the center when they become aware of it. Over the last several years, tech firms and social media companies have developed increasingly powerful tools to proactively identify and remove online abuse.

Story continues

Spokespeople for Reddit, Grindr, Discord, Amazon Photo, Twitch, Meta and Snapchat cited advanced detection of online abuse when asked to comment on the increase in reports. Many also said theyâre committed to removing the material.

Omegle, TikTok and Google didnât immediately respond to a request for comment. A Microsoft spokesperson shared the companyâs digital safety content report. Amazon said it only began collecting the data in June, 2021.

246,2023-06-06T21:45:23+00:00,"California bill advances, requiring Big Tech to pay for news","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) â Big Tech companies such as Google and Meta might soon have to pay media outlets for posting and using their news content under a proposed California measure attempting to save local journalism.

The bill, which cleared an important Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday with bipartisan support, would require Google and Meta to share with California media companies their advertising revenue stemming from the news and other reported content. The amount would be determined through an arbitration process.

Supporters of the bill said it would provide a âlifelineâ to local news organizations that have seen their advertising revenues nosedive in the digital era. Opponents, including trade groups and some journalism groups, said the legislation would be an unprecedented mandate that violates the First Amendment.

The bill would mandate that at least 70% of their revenue go to local news organizations to help pay for reporters' salaries. Big Tech companies would also be prohibited from retaliating against a news outlet for demanding a fee by excluding their content on the platforms.

âAs news consumption has moved online, community news outlets have been downsized and closing at an alarming rate,â said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks of Oakland, who authored the bill, said during the Tuesday hearing.

The Democrat said that California has lost more than 100 news organizations in the past decade.

âThe dominant type platforms, both search engines and social networks, have such unrivaled market power that newsrooms are coerced to share the content they produce, which tech companies sell advertising against for almost no compensation in return,â she said, noting her bill is being backed by major journalism unions such as the News Media Alliance and Media Guild of the West, which represents The Los Angeles Times and other newsrooms.

But critics of the bill said the legislation is unconstitutional for requiring online platforms to post content from all news organizations. It would also reward clickbait content and limit the ability for Google and Meta to fight misinformation on their platforms as it could be seen as retaliation, said a representative from Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.

Story continues

Chris Krewson, executive director of LION Publishers, a national news group representing more than 450 independent newsrooms, said the bill is âfundamentally flawedâ and wasn't written with small newsrooms in mind.

The bill would mostly benefit newspaper chains and hedge funds that have gutted local newsrooms in the last few decades, he said. His group represents more than 50 local newsrooms in California, 80% of which are operations with five or fewer journalists. Most of those news outlets wouldn't meet the requirements to benefit, he said.

âI applaud the lawmaker for getting bipartisan support on this,â Krewson said in an interview Tuesday. âBut this is backward.â

Over the last two years, LION Publishers has received at least $1 million in funding from Meta but Krewson said he's not speaking on the tech company's behalf.

Similar efforts to bolster local news companies have been attempted across the United States, Australia and Canada, among others, with various levels of success. Australia adopted a law in 2021 that resulted in $140 million in payments to news companies from Google and Facebook last year.

U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for similar initiatives, reintroducing a bill in March that failed in the last congressional session and would have allowed news companies to jointly negotiate an advertising rate with tech giants such as Google.

Meta declined to comment on the California bill but pointed to a statement it made to the U.S. Congress in 2022 and another it made to the Canadian government this year when it threatened to pull all news content from its platform if the company would have to pay for news. Google didn't respond to an email seeking comment on the California bill.

Despite clearing another hurdle Tuesday, questions remain about how the bill would be implemented. Some lawmakers noted that Meta's Facebook and Google do not operate the same way. Google scrapes news websites and provides users with summaries of reported content, while Facebook shows content such as photos, videos and articles to users based on their activities on the platform.

Democratic Assemblymember Matt Haney of San Francisco said he's also concerned with how the state would ensure the money goes to local journalists.

âHow do we actually make sure that this isn't simply profits handed from one company to another big company?"" he asked at the hearing Thursday.

Wicks said she plans to have clarifications on those concerns before the June 2 deadline, which is the last day the Assembly could vote on the bill before it is taken up by the Senate. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has not indicated whether he would back such legislation."

Artificial intelligence (AI) will âcause real damageâ when it gets into the hands of âbad actorsâ, a Microsoft boss has warned.

Michael Schwarz, the US tech companyâs chief economist, told the World Economic Forum (WEF): âI am confident AI will be used by bad actors, and yes it will cause real damage.â

âIt can do a lot of damage in the hands of spammers with elections and so on,â he said in comments reported by Bloomberg.

His warning echoed that of Geoffrey Hinton, the âgodfather of AIâ who quit Google this week.

Mr Hinton said in a newspaper interview: âIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.â

Mr Schwarzâs comments come as the bosses of Microsoft, Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have been summoned to the White House to meet US vice president Kamala Harris on Thursday.

The meeting has been called so officials can hold a âfrank discussionâ with tech company leaders about the risks of upcoming AI technology.

Scientists from Microsoft and OpenAI claimed in March that they had seen âsparksâ of human-level intelligence from the latterâs latest creation during laboratory tests. May0078295 The Daily Telegraph AI - Artificial Intelligence - Toronto, Ontario Canada.

He divides his time working for Google and University of Toronto Pictured in his office at Google HQ in Toronto. Weds 16/08/17 - Julian Simmonds

This so-called artificial general intelligence could foreshadow the creation of autonomous robots capable of making their own decisions completely independently from human input.

OpenAIâs November release of ChatGPT took the world by storm as the AI chatbot surpassed all previous expectations of the technology.

Its unique selling point is that it is trained on petabytes of data from across the entire internet, meaning users can ask it questions on virtually any topic and receive convincing-sounding answers.

Experts have warned that AI chatbots are capable of âhallucinatingâ answers that may be completely wrong, however.

âThis kind of AI we're talking about right now can sometimes lead to something we call hallucination,â Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Search, told a German newspaper in February.

Around $120bn (Â£96bn) was wiped from Googleâs market value later that month after its ChatGPT rival, Bard, gave a convincing-but-wrong answer to a question. The response was then reproduced in launch publicity material for the chatbot.

Bard gave an inaccurate answer to the question: âWhat new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?â

It falsely suggested the telescope was used to make the very first discoveries of planets outside the solar system.

New Media vs. Old Media: Winners & Losers

Mainstream Media âShake-Upsâ Gain Momentum

Traditionally, the media tracks and reports the news instead of making the news. However, yesterday, news broke that Vice Media (once valued in the billions) was filing for bankruptcy.

Before the Vice announcement, on the same day in April, national news also broke that anchors Don Lemon of CNN and Tucker Carson of Fox News would no longer work in their respective posts on their networks. Before migrating to a morning show, Lemon had been the anchor of the prime-time show âDon Lemon Tonightâ for years. Meanwhile, Carlson hosted âTucker Carlson Tonightâ â the most viewed cable news show on television for most of its existence. Both anchors were âstaplesâ for their respective networks. Politically, Lemon catered to the left and Carlson to the right.

The âshake-upâ occurring in the mainstream media is nothing new. For various reasons, Fox News, part of publicly traded Fox, has parted ways with popular prime-time anchors such as Bill OâReilly and Megyn Kelly. In recent years, CNN, part of Warner Bros Discovery, has done the same â parting ways with Chris Cuomo and other high-profile anchors.

What is causing the departures?

Unlike alternative media mediums,networks such as Fox and CNN are beholden to political, reputational, and sponsorship pressures.

Is the Legacy Media Dying?

From a valuation perspective, the space has merit. For example, Fox has a P/E ratio of 10x earnings, which compares favorably to the S&P valuation of 19x.

Considering the entire industryâs fundamentals, making any conclusions in one direction or another is tough. On an earnings-per-share basis, Warner Bros. has chalked up losses for three straight quarters. Fox is highly profitable and saw year-over-year EPS growth of 269% last quarter. However, the Broadcast Radio and Television group has been an avoid over the past five years, underperforming the S&P 500 dramatically and ranking in the bottom 35% of industries tracked by Zacks.

Story continues

Due to the underperformance of the industry and the uncertain impact of the recent departures, investors should avoid FOXA and WBD at this juncture.

The New York Times is the most attractive legacy media player. The Publishing â Newspapers group is the number one ranked group tracked by Zacks. Furthermore, the company is profitable and saw EPS grow 37% last quarter. Finally, the stock is showing strength. Year-to-date, NYT is higher by 21.4% - more than three times the return of the S&P 500 over the same time.

New Mediaâs Rise

Thus far, the most apparent winner of the recent media mayhem is Spotify. Spotify is home to the worldâs most popular podcast, âThe Joe Rogan Experience.â SPOT is higher by 73% year-to-date, trouncing the performance of the old media stocks. Outlets like Spotify can offer more niche and personalized experiences, such as long-form content on the Rogan podcast.

The sports â media industry is another side of the business likely to see big winners and losers. YouTube parent Alphabet, recently paid $2 billion to gain the rights to âSunday NFL Ticket.â DirecTV previously held the rights to Sunday Ticket. The bold bet by Google is profound in that football fans will no longer be beholden to having satellite or long-term contracts.

Conclusion

Shake-ups in traditional media outlets are hitting a fever pitch. Though the underlying stocks have low valuations, future earnings may slow as the advent of non-traditional media fragments the market. Avoid old sluggish media companies like Fox and WBD and focus on new, disruptive entrants such as Spotify and Google.

Why Havenât You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

With one data center already up and running near Columbus, the two new locations will bring Google's total investment in Ohio to more than $2 billion, officials said.

Ohio is seeing a wave of big investments by the technology industry.

Intel is building a $20 billion chip factory just east of Columbus, and Honda and LG Energy Solution of South Korea are building a $3.5 billion battery plant between Columbus and Cincinnati that the automaker envisions as its North American electric vehicle hub.

The area around Columbus also is home to data centers operated by Facebook and Amazon.

The two new Google data centers will be built in Columbus and Lancaster.

âOhio is a growing technology hub and data center market, and we welcome these two new Google projects in Columbus and Lancaster to complement the one already in New Albany,â Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement.

Mark Isakowitz, Googleâs head of government affairs in the U.S. and Canada, would not say how many jobs would be created, adding that data centers typically employ about 50 people at opening and those numbers increase as they expand.

âIf you look at some of the sites we have around the country, itâs hundreds and hundreds of people as you build and as you grow,â he said.

Data centers have proliferated across the U.S. and become a welcome revenue source for local governments. They also require a large amount of electricity and high-voltage transmission lines.

In northern Virginia, which is home to the biggest cluster of data centers, complaints have grown mostly about the constant noise from fans needed to cool the computers and servers."

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Britain's antitrust regulator was on Wednesday refused permission to appeal against a ruling that it had no power to open an investigation into Apple Inc's mobile browser and cloud gaming services.

Apple won an appeal in March against the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to open a full investigation into the dominance of Apple and Alphabet Inc's Google in mobile browsers.

The Competition Appeal Tribunal quashed the decision to open the investigation and on Wednesday refused the CMA's application for permission to appeal against that ruling.

The CMA can still take its bid for permission to appeal against the tribunal's ruling directly to the Court of Appeal.

""We are carefully considering the tribunal's decision and are considering our next steps,"" a CMA spokesperson said.

The CMA had said in March that the ruling ""risks substantially undermining the CMA's ability to efficiently and effectively investigate and intervene in markets"".

But, in its decision refusing permission to appeal, the tribunal said that the law on when the CMA can open a market investigation is clear.

""The letter of the law matters, even if it generates undesirable or unfortunate results,"" the tribunal said. (Reporting by Sam Tobin, Editing by Paul Sandle)"

GOOGLE, MICROSOFT CEOS TO TALK AI WITH VP HARRIS

This brings together two issues. What to do with AI, and what to do with the vice president, now that she's been confirmed on Biden's re-election ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden

Interesting that the meeting takes place, right before the lifting of Title 42. Harris was an unsuccessful border czar. The AI meeting is a convenient distraction.

A source told FOX Business it's all part of her ""rebranding."" Elevate the 58-year-old VP to offset concerns over the 80-year-old president.

READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP

DEMOCRATS ARE STUCK WITH BIDEN AND âTERRIFIEDâ OF KAMALA HARRIS: STUART VARNEY

Does the vice president offset your concerns over Biden's age? That's not what every poll tells us.

The natural inclination of this administration is to reach for control. To regulate. So the bureaucrats take over from the entrepreneurs and stick the dead hand of government into a brand-new technology.  Artificial intelligence

The invitation to the executives says, ""Companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.""

Ok, but that sounds an awful lot like that call for a pause on AI development. That's the ultimate regulation. Stop what you're doing. Unfortunately, the bad guys will not stop what they're doing.

I think we should go the other way. Don't pause AI development, because you can't.

GOOGLE, MICROSOFT BOTH TOUT AI ADVANCES TO IMPROVE SEARCH

Don't turn the business over to government bureaucrats, because bureaucrats don't make good innovators.

Let Microsoft, Google, and others compete to develop the best products. AI is dominated by America. Let's keep it that way.

Schwarz cautioned against damage from spammers with elections, calling out lawmakers and emphasizing stricter laws backing AI, BloombergÂ reports. Artificial intelligence tools face increased scrutiny as their use exploded in recent months following the debut ofÂ ChatGPT. On Thursday, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with the CEOs of Microsoft,Â Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and OpenAI Inc to explore ways to reduce the risk of harm from AI technologies. MicrosoftÂ is working on guardrails to help mitigate the potential danger from AI tools, Schwarz said. It already uses OpenAIâs ChatGPT in its Bing search product, and Google released its rival Bard chatbot in March. Schwarz advocated the upsides of AI,Â including more productive human output, revolutionizing how most businesses operate, and changing everything in the long run. AI will likely be a key driver of turbulence in global labor markets and will play a role in changes for nearly a quarter of international jobs, according to a WEF report.

262,2023-06-05T23:01:00+00:00,"Stock Market Today: Dow slips as Fed hikes again, moves to data-dependent stance","Investing.com -- The Dow gave up gains to close lower Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates, and signaled a possible pause in June, though said incoming economic data would ultimately sway its decision.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, or 270 points, the Nasdaq slipped 0.5%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.7%.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday, and tweaked the language in its policy statement to signal that a June pause was in play but said future decisions will be determined by incoming data.

The tweak in policy language marked a ""meaningful change,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, [as] ""we were no longer saying that we anticipate [some additional policy firming].""

""[I]n our view this new language suggests the Committeeâs base case is to pause in Juneâin line with our forecast, consensus, and market pricingâand the onus is on data to surprise to the upside for rates to rise further,"" RBC said in a note.

Bank stocks pushed the broader market lower amid worries the higher for longer rate regime will continue to hurt regional banks.

Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION), Comerica Inc (NYSE:CMA), and Invesco Dynamic Market (NYSE:PWC) were among the biggest decliners.

The slide in Treasury yields slipped following the Fed decision, failed to boost rate sensitive areas of the market as tech slid.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) gave up the bulk of its gained to close just above the flatline, while META and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slipped just a day ahead of the latterâs results.

Apple is expected to report quarterly results after closing bell on Thursday, with investor focus likely to be on signs of iPhone demand just as global growth jitters persist.

âWe believe iPhone units based on a clear uptick in demand around the key China region this quarter could show some upside despite the shaky macro as higher average selling prices and overall upgrade activity on iPhone Pro 14 carry the day for Cook&Co,â Wedbush said in a recent note.

Story continues

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), meanwhile, was pressured by regulator concerns after the Federal Trade Commission proposed a ban on Facebook from monetizing the data of children and teens under 18 alleging that social media company violated a previous privacy order.

Chip stocks were also a big drag on the broader tech sector, paced by a 9% decline in Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) after the chipmakerâs somewhat underwhelming guidance and concerns about its margins overshadowed better-than-expected quarterly results.

âThe optics around [AMDâs] data center are not great and estimates are going to have to come down again,â UBS said, adding that gross margin is âprobably the biggest concern in our eyes as it is being guided flatâ

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) bucked the trend lower after reporting positive results from its Alzheimerâs drug that paves the way to file for FDA approval by the end of June.

Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) was also ended higher, up 2%, after the consumer staples company lifted its annual guidance following better-than-expected quarterly results as price hikes boosted performance.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) plunged 9% even as the coffee chain reported quarterly results that topped analyst estimates as growth in China returned following the countryâs reopening from its Covid lockdown.

The meeting, according to an invitation obtained by Yahoo Finance, promises to be a âfrank discussion of the risks we each see in current and near-term AI development,â as well as possible actions to mitigate those risks.

In attendance will be the Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai , Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, according to the White House.

""This is complicated,"" said Secretary Raimondo in an interview with Yahoo Finance ahead of the gathering. ""Probably the most complicated tech policy discussion possibly that we've ever had, and the administration wants to be very serious and thoughtful about it."" Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

The meeting comes as the explosive growth of platforms like ChatGPT has tech leaders and Washington policymakers debating how heavy a hand Washington should have in the emerging technology in the years ahead. There are concerns AI could have widespread implications in the national security arena as well as in American society overall.

A technology that could âscrew up our democracyâ

AI is a technology so powerful that it even has the potential to âallow an evil country, competitor to come in and screw up our democracy,â former Google CEO and Chairman Eric Schmidt told Yahoo Finance this week from the 2023 Milken Global Conference.

Schmidt added that the potential and dangers of AI â many of the most visible AI applications, like OpenAIâs ChatGPT, are currently less than six months old â will take a long time to be felt across the country and in Washington.

âIf you look at the history of technology, itâs a decade before you really see the transformative nature of it,â he said.

Still, regulating AI is tricky, especially since tech regulation hasnât been Washingtonâs strong suit.

Story continues

Europe has been more proactive when it comes to tech regulation at-large, instituting laws like General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which governs how personal data can be used in the European Union. However, in terms of AI, there's still a lot of feeling around in the dark. In this respect, Schmidt told Yahoo Finance, the U.S. isnât alone.

""At the moment, Europe is doing almost nothing in this space, so we don't really have any examples,"" he said. ""They have a law which requires that the system be able to explain itself if it's used in something critical. By definition, these systems today can't explain themselves â by the way, nor could your teenager if you have a teenager.""

A representative for Anthropic confirmed to Yahoo Finance that they will be in attendance Thursday at the White House. Representatives from Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

A series of plans from Washington DC

A White House official says that this weekâs meeting is part of a broader administration effort to engage with the technology and formulate a response from the government. Another shoe set to drop later this month is a formal report planned from Raimondoâs department with recommendations on how the government should approach AI technology.

The Commerce Department group - dubbed the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee - is looking at national security as well as how AI could have social implication. That includes the introduction of bias as AI applications find their way into more and more corners of American life.

""When social media and such was being developed, there was this mantra of move fast and break things,"" Raimondo said in an interview. ""We can't allow that to happen here."" AI has great potential, she added, ""however with those opportunities come substantial risk, risks that we may not even understand fully today."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in 2021 at the White House. (REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein)

The plan also comes in addition to recent releases from the Biden administration around things like an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework for the technology.

On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has announced his own effort to âget aheadâ of artificial intelligence, linking the issue directly with Americaâs ongoing competition with China.

The Senate leader says he is working on what he describes as âa new regulatory regime that would prevent potentially catastrophic damage to our country while simultaneously making sure the U.S. advances and leads in this transformative technology.â

Also in attendance at Thursday's meeting will be a range of top White House officials from Chief of Staff Jeff Zients to National Security advisor Jake Sullivan to NEC Director Lael Brainard.

The invitation notes that Biden officials will press the companies on safety, noting an âexpectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.â

264,2023-06-05T20:05:11+00:00,Scientists warn of AI dangers but don't agree on solutions,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) â Computer scientists who helped build the foundations of todayâs artificial intelligence technology are warning of its dangers, but that doesnât mean they agree on what those dangers are or how to prevent them.

Humanity's survival is threatened when ""smart things can outsmart us,â so-called Godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton said at a conference Wednesday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

âIt may keep us around for a while to keep the power stations running,â Hinton said. âBut after that, maybe not.â

After retiring from Google so he could speak more freely, the 75-year-old Hinton said he's recently changed his views about the reasoning capabilities of the computer systems he's spent a lifetime researching.

âThese things will have learned from us, by reading all the novels that ever were and everything Machiavelli ever wrote, how to manipulate people,â Hinton said, addressing the crowd attending MIT Technology Review's EmTech Digital conference from his home via video. âEven if they canât directly pull levers, they can certainly get us to pull levers.â

âI wish I had a nice simple solution I could push, but I donât,â he added. âIâm not sure there is a solution.â

Fellow AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, co-winner with Hinton of the top computer science prize, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he's âpretty much alignedâ with Hinton's concerns brought on by chatbots such as ChatGPT and related technology, but worries that to simply say âWe're doomedâ is not going to help.

âThe main difference, I would say, is heâs kind of a pessimistic person, and Iâm more on the optimistic side,â said Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal. âI do think that the dangers â the short-term ones, the long-term ones â are very serious and need to be taken seriously by not just a few researchers but governments and the population.â

There are plenty of signs that governments are listening. The White House has called in the CEOs of Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to meet Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris in what's being described by officials as a frank discussion on how to mitigate both the near-term and long-term risks of their technology. European lawmakers are also accelerating negotiations to pass sweeping new AI rules.

Story continues

But all the talk of the most dire future dangers has some worried that hype around superhuman machines â which don't exist â is distracting from attempts to set practical safeguards on current AI products that are largely unregulated and have been shown to cause real-world harms.

Margaret Mitchell, a former leader on Googleâs AI ethics team, said sheâs upset that Hinton didnât speak out during his decade in a position of power at Google, especially after the 2020 ouster of prominent Black scientist Timnit Gebru, who had studied the harms of large language models before they were widely commercialized into products such as ChatGPT and Googleâs Bard.

âItâs a privilege that he gets to jump from the realities of the propagation of discrimination now, the propagation of hate language, the toxicity and nonconsensual pornography of women, all of these issues that are actively harming people who are marginalized in tech,â said Mitchell, who was also forced out of Google in the aftermath of Gebru's departure. âHeâs skipping over all of those things to worry about something farther off.â

Bengio, Hinton and a third researcher, Yann LeCun, who works at Facebook parent Meta, were all awarded the Turing Prize in 2019 for their breakthroughs in the field of artificial neural networks, instrumental to the development of today's AI applications such as ChatGPT.

Bengio, the only one of the three who didn't take a job with a tech giant, has voiced concerns for years about near-term AI risks, including job market destabilization, automated weaponry and the dangers of biased data sets.

But those concerns have grown recently, leading Bengio to join other computer scientists and tech business leaders like Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in calling for a six-month pause on developing AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's latest model, GPT-4.

Bengio said Wednesday he believes the latest AI language models already pass the âTuring testâ named after British codebreaker and AI pioneer Alan Turing's method introduced in 1950 to measure when AI becomes indistinguishable from a human â at least on the surface.

âThatâs a milestone that can have drastic consequences if weâre not careful,â Bengio said. âMy main concern is how they can be exploited for nefarious purposes to destabilize democracies, for cyberattacks, disinformation. You can have a conversation with these systems and think that youâre interacting with a human. Theyâre difficult to spot.â

Where researchers are less likely to agree is on how current AI language systems â which have many limitations, including a tendency to fabricate information â might actually get smarter than humans not just in memorizing huge troves of information, but in showing critical reasoning and other human skills.

Aidan Gomez was one of the co-authors of the pioneering 2017 paper that introduced a so-called transformer technique â the âTâ at the end of ChatGPT â for improving the performance of machine-learning systems, especially in how they learn from passages of text. Then just a 20-year-old intern at Google, Gomez remembers laying on a couch at the company's California headquarters when his team sent out the paper around 3 a.m. when it was due.

âAidan, this is going to be so huge,â he remembers a colleague telling him, of the work that's since helped lead to new systems that can generate humanlike prose and imagery.

Six years later and now CEO of his own AI company called Cohere, which Hinton has invested in, Gomez is enthused about the potential applications of these systems but bothered by fearmongering he says is âdetached from the realityâ of their true capabilities and ârelies on extraordinary leaps of imagination and reasoning.""

âThe notion that these models are somehow gonna get access to our nuclear weapons and launch some sort of extinction-level event is not a productive discourse to have,â Gomez said. ""Itâs harmful to those real pragmatic policy efforts that are trying to do something good.â

Asked about his investments in Cohere on Wednesday in light of his broader concerns about AI, Hinton said he had no plans to pull his investments because there are still many helpful applications of language models in medicine and elsewhere. He also said he hadn't made any bad decisions in pursuing the research he started in the 1970s.

âUntil very recently, I thought this existential crisis was a long way off,â Hinton said. âSo I donât really have any regrets about what I did.â"

Apple could make or break Big Tech's earnings season

Big Tech has, so far, managed to beat Wall Streetâs expectations this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) have largely outperformed analystsâ estimates despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending.

But the industryâs biggest test comes after the bell Thursday when Apple (AAPL) reports its fiscal second quarter earnings results. Thatâs because the iPhone maker not only serves as a bellwether for the tech sector as a whole, but also on consumer spending.

âNone of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,â explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.

âAnd the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,â Munster added. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14 range in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., September 16, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly

In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.

Apple could swing its rivals

Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.

âWe believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,â Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.

Story continues

Apple, along with rival Microsoft, has a massive influence on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Together they make up roughly 13% of the indexâs market value. Apple, however, outweighs even Microsoft, thanks to its higher market cap of $2.67 trillion. Microsoftâs market cap sits at $2.27 trillion.

For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.

A key to consumer spending

While Appleâs enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the companyâs performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.

âMost, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,â explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. âSo it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.â

A miss on Appleâs revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.

It all comes down to Thursday night. Buckle up.

âWe do have to worry a lot about [the] safety of this technologyâjust like with any other technology,â Michael Schwarz said about artificial intelligence during a World Economic Forum panel on Wednesday.

Vehicles, for example, get people to where they want to go. But theyâre also a danger because of accidents and pollution.

âI hope that A.I. will never, ever become as deadly as [an] internal combustion engine is,â Schwarz said.

A.I.âs dangers can be hard to dismiss even for companies working on them, and Schwarz acknowledges that the technology can cause harm in the wrong hands.

âI am quite confident that A.I. will be used by bad actors, and yes it will cause real damage,â Schwarz said. âIt can do a lot of damage in the hands of spammers, people who want to manipulate elections and so on.â

But some of that can be avoided, he said. âOnce we see real harm, we have to ask ourselves the simple question: âCan we regulate that in a way where the good things that will be prevented by this regulation are less important?ââ Schwarz said. âThe principles should be the benefits from the regulation to our society should be greater than the cost to our society.â

Microsoft is focused on the good that A.I. can bring society and is working to develop A.I. to âhelp people achieve moreâ by making them more efficient, Schwarz said.

âWe are optimistic about the future of A.I., and we think A.I. advances will solve many more challenges than they present, but we have also been consistent in our belief that when you create technologies that can change the world, you must also ensure that the technology is used responsibly,â a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune.

Story continues

Microsoft has been a key player in the recent surge of generative A.I. technology. The company has built a chatbot using technology from OpenAI and has incorporated it into a number of products. Microsoft also plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI over several years, after having already pumped money into the startup in 2019 and 2021.

Schwarzâs warning about A.I. echoed, to a point, recent remarks by Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google VP and engineering fellow, who helped create some of the key technologies powering the widely used A.I. tools today and who is referred to as âthe Godfather of A.I.â He warned that it may be tough to stop A.I. from being used for fraud.

âIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,â Hinton told the New York Times in an interview published Monday.

âI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadnât done it, somebody else would have.â

One of Hintonâs concerns is the availability of A.I. tools that can create images and aggregate information in a matter of seconds. They could lead to the spread of fake content whose accuracy the average person would have trouble discerning.

While Schwarz and Hinton worry about how bad actors may misuse A.I., the two experts diverge in how they think A.I. may impact certain jobs.

During the WEF panel, Schwarz said people are âparanoidâ about their work being replaced by A.I. and that they âshouldnât be too worriedâ about it. But Hinton, who had worked at Google since 2013 until recently, said that there is a real risk to jobs in an A.I.-dominated work environment.

âIt takes away the drudge work,â Hinton said. âIt might take away more than that.â

Calls to halt advanced A.I. development

In March, over 25,000 tech expertsâfrom academics to former executivesâsigned an open letter asking for a six-month pause in the development of advanced A.I. systems so that their impact could be better understood and regulated by governments. The letter argued that some systems, such as OpenAIâs GPT-4 introduced earlier that month, are âbecoming human-competitive at general tasks,â threatening to help generate misinformation and potentially automating jobs at a large scale.

Executives at tech giants like Google and Microsoft have said that a six-month pause will not solve the problem. Among them is Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

âI think in the actual specifics of it, itâs not fully clear to me how you would do something like that today,â he said during a podcast interview in March, referring to the six-month moratorium. âTo me, at least, there is no way to do this effectively without getting governments involved. So I think thereâs a lot more thought that needs to go into it.â

Microsoftâs chief scientific officer told Fortune in an interview in April that there are alternatives to pausing A.I. development.

âTo me, I would prefer to see more knowledge, and even an acceleration of research and development, rather than a pause for six months, which I am not sure if it would even be feasible,â said Microsoftâs Eric Horvitz. âIn a larger sense, six months doesnât really mean very much for a pause. We need to really just invest more in understanding and guiding and even regulating this technologyâjump in, as opposed to pause.â

267,2023-06-05T18:14:02+00:00,Google wins US patent trial over data-retrieval technology,"By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google LLC won a jury trial on Tuesday in a long-running patent lawsuit in Delaware federal court over features in Google's smartphones and apps.

The jury decided that Luxembourg-based patent owner Arendi SARL's patent was invalid and that Google did not infringe it, according to the verdict made public on Wednesday.

Attorneys for Arendi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google spokesperson JosÃ© CastaÃ±eda said the company was pleased with the decision and appreciated the jury's ""careful attention to the extensive evidence presented in this case.""

Norwegian inventor Atle Hedloy's Arendi sued Google in 2013 over the patent, which relates to retrieving information like names and addresses from a database and entering it into word processors and spreadsheets.

Arendi alleged that Google's mobile devices and apps including Gmail, Chrome, Docs and Messages infringed. It asked the court for $45.5 million in damages, according to a spokesperson for Google's law firm Paul Hastings.

The jury determined that Google did not infringe Arendi's patent and agreed with Google's argument that the patent was invalid based on earlier publications that disclosed the same invention.

Arendi has also sued other tech companies including Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Samsung Electronics Co over related patents. Those cases have all been dismissed or resolved."
268,2023-06-05T17:36:52+00:00,Hate passwords? You're in luck - Google is sidelining them,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â Good news for all the password-haters out there: Google has taken a big step toward making them an afterthought by adding âpasskeysâ as a more straightforward and secure way to log into its services.

Here's what you need to know:

WHAT ARE PASSKEYS?

Passkeys offer a safer alternative to passwords and texted confirmation codes. Users wonât ever see them directly; instead, an online service like Gmail will use them to communicate directly with a trusted device such as your phone or computer to log you in.

All you'll have to do is verify your identity on the device using a PIN unlock code, biometrics such as your fingerprint or a face scan or a more sophisticated physical security dongle.

Google designed its passkeys to work with a variety of devices, so you can use them on iPhones, Macs and Windows computers as well as Googleâs own Android phones.

WHY ARE PASSKEYS NECESSARY?

Thanks to clever hackers and human fallibility, passwords are just too easy to steal or defeat. And making them more complex just opens the door to users defeating themselves.

For starters, many people choose passwords they can remember â and easy-to-recall passwords are also easy to hack. For years, analysis of hacked password caches found that the most common password in use was âpassword123.â A more recent study by the password manager NordPass found that itâs now just âpassword.â This isnât fooling anyone.

Passwords are also frequently compromised in security breaches. Stronger passwords are more secure, but only if you choose ones that are unique, complex and non-obvious. And once youâve settled on âerVex411$%â as your password, good luck remembering it.

In short, passwords put security and ease of use directly at odds. Software-based password managers, which can create and store complex passwords for you, are valuable tools that can improve security. But even password managers have a master password you need to protect, and that plunges you back into the swamp.

In addition to sidestepping all those problems, passkeys have one additional advantage over passwords. Theyâre specific to particular websites, so scammer sites canât steal a passkey from a dating site and use it to raid your bank account.

HOW DO I START USING PASSKEYS?

First step is to enable them for your Google account. On any trusted phone or computer, open the browser and sign into your Google account. Then visit the page g.co/passkeys and click the option to âstart using passkeys.â Voila! The passkey feature is now activated for that account.

If you're on an Apple device, you'll first be prompted to set up the Keychain app if you're not already using it; it securely stores passwords and now passkeys as well.

Next step is to create the actual passkeys that will connect your trusted device. If you're using an Android phone that's already logged into your Google account, you're most of the way there; Android phones are automatically ready to use passkeys, though you still have enable the function first.

On the same Google account page noted above, look for the âCreate a passkeyâ button. Pressing it will open a window and let you create a passkey either on your current device or on another device. There's no wrong choice; the system will simply notify you if that passkey already exists.

If you're on a PC that can't create a passkey, it will open a QR code that you can scan with the ordinary cameras on iPhones and Android devices. You may have to move the phone closer until the message âSet up passkeyâ appears on the image. Tap that and you're on your way.

AND THEN WHAT?

From that point on, signing into Google will only require you to enter your email address. If you've gotten passkeys set up properly, you'll simply get a message on your phone or other device asking you to for your fingerprint, your face or a PIN.

Of course, your password is still there. But if passkeys take off, odds are good you won't be needing it very much. You may even choose to delete it from your account someday."

Itâs when a machine can understand the world at least as well as a human. Experts say it will take a few years to a few decades to achieve the goal, if it can even truly exist. The head of Googleâs main A.I. research lab, for one, leans toward sooner rather than later.

âI think weâll have very capable, very general systems in the next few years,â Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, said Tuesday during a conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal.

âThe progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible,â he continued. âI donât see any reason why that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So I think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade away.â

A.I. has been the exception to the tech sectorâs downturn over the past year, with companies and venture capital firms doubling down on the technology. Much of that money is flowing to develop generative A.I., algorithms that can generate text or images based on specific prompts.

Yet research, which looks even farther ahead, is already moving on from generative A.I. to AGI, according to 56% of computer scientists and A.I. researchers polled in a Stanford University survey last month. AGI would be significantly more sophisticated because it would be aware of what it says and does. Theoretically, it would be far less likely to spit out the inaccuracies and confused statements that tarnish the image of the current technology, which relies on large amounts of training data and predictive models to help it anticipate the most likely answer to what itâs asked to do.

Story continues

DeepMind, acquired by Google in 2014, made headlines in 2021 when it publicized the results of its A.I. system AlphaFold, which predicted the structure of every known protein in the human genome. The milestone has huge implications for disease and medicinal research. And last year, the company made headlines again by analyzing the structure of almost every protein known to science, releasing over 200 million predictions in a free-to-access database. DeepMind has also developed A.I. that is capable of diagnosing complex eye diseases; systems that cut its parent companyâs energy bills by 40%; and software that turns text into speech.

Last month, Google announced it was integrating its core A.I. research team with DeepMind and appointing Hassabis as the combined unitâs CEO to accelerate the companyâs push toward AGI. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement that the overhaul would âhelp power the next generation of our products and services.â

Fast-tracked AGI development is not without its critics, however. Around 58% of A.I. experts called AGI an âimportant concernâ in the Stanford survey, with 36% saying it could lead to a ânuclear-level catastrophe.â Some experts said AGI could represent a technological singularity, a hypothetical future moment when machines irreversibly surpass human abilities and could pose a threat to civilization.

Over 1,000 technologists and A.I. experts including Elon Musk and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak signed an open letter in March calling for a six-month halt on advanced A.I. development to reprioritize ethics research.Â  One of the signatoriesâ concerns was dangers from unrestrained superhuman A.I.

Other observers have argued that advanced A.I. could cause severe damage to society if it is not reined in and aligned with human values. Paul Christiano, an A.I. researcher who formerly led safety and alignment work at OpenAI, cautioned last week that unchecked AGI development could lead to a âfull-blown A.I. takeover scenarioâ that destroys humanity. Yuval Harari, author of the popular science book Sapiens and one of the open letterâs signatories, also wrote in The Economist last week that A.I. was akin to a poorly understood âalien intelligence, here on Earthâ that could represent the âend of democracyâ if used unethically.

Speaking on stage Tuesday, Hassabis promised DeepMindâs work on AGI wonât put civilization at risk anytime soon, as the companyâs current priority is to integrate A.I. with more products, which he predicted would be as game-changing as the first iPhone.

Hassabis also said Google would responsibly develop AGI, and asserted his view that the technology should be used in âa cautious manner using the scientific method where you try and do very careful controlled experiments to understand what the underlying system does.â

Engineers have been in demand since ancient times. However, the most significant impact of the engineering services started in the 18th century. Engineering services are the backbone of technological growth which is one of the three main factors of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The TFP has a correlation of 60% with economic progress in advanced countries.

The global engineering services market was worth $707 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach around $1.22 trillion in 2023, registering a CAGR of 5.9%. The market share of engineering services was largely captured by North America at 38%, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% during the forecasted period. On the other hand, the CAGR in East Asia is expected to be 6.5%.

In the United States, engineering services contributed to 3% of the jobs and accounted for 2.8% of the countryâs GDP in 2020. In addition, they were also responsible for $64.5 billion in taxes paid. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in architecture and engineering is expected to grow by 4% between 2021 and 2031 and their median annual income was $79,840 in May 2021, which was almost 75% more than the average median income of all occupations. The highest median income was recorded by petroleum engineers at $130,850 per year or $62.91 per hour and employment in the field is expected to grow by 8%. It was followed by computer hardware engineers with a median income of $128,170 per year or $61.62 per hour.

One of the major growth prospects of the engineering industry in the United States is The CHIPS and Science Act, an act that will provide $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development. The semiconductor industry is highly dependent on engineers as they are the ones who have to design, produce, and test the products. In light of the news, the semiconductor company Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) announced an additional $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing.

Story continues

The CHIPS Act is also expected to benefit the industrial sectorâs engineering and construction industry as it will lead to huge construction projects of new semiconductor plants, research centers, and general infrastructure. The automotive industry which is dependent on mechanical and electrical engineering is also set to benefit from the act as semiconductors are essential for the growing demand of electric vehicles in the market.

Engineering includes a very broad scope of sciences and has significant importance in the defense, construction, software, automotive, and energy sector, along with many others. In our article, hedge fund sentiment has been used as a primary criteria for stock selection but since the engineering sector covers many companies, we wonât be able to discuss all of them. However, some of the important engineering stocks that have been discussed are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc.

Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.

Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Teslaâs sales.

We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The companyâs technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitorsâ offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.â

TORONTO, May 3 (Reuters) - Google may be forced to remove links to news articles found in Canadian search results if the government passes legislation to compel internet companies to pay news publishers, a company executive told lawmakers on Wednesday.

Canada's proposed legislation would force platforms like Alphabet Inc, Googleâs parent, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc to negotiate commercial deals and pay Canadian news publishers for their content, part of a broader global trend to make tech firms pay for news.

""The extreme level of business uncertainty and uncapped financial liability that Google is being asked to accept ... is unreasonable,"" Google vice president of news Richard Gingras said in testimony to a Senate committee.

""If we must pay publishers simply for linking to their sites, making us lose money with every click, it would be reasonable for us, or any business, to reconsider why we would continue to do so,"" he added.

This year, Google tested blocking some Canadian users' access to news as a potential response to the legislation, a move Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a ""terrible mistake.""

Google last year linked to Canadian news publishers more than 3.6 billion times, Gingras said, which helped those companies make money on ads and new subscriptions.

Introduced in April 2022, the bill, known as Bill C-18, is the latest legislation that aims to make digital media platforms pay their fair share for linking news content.

Ottawa's proposal is similar to a ground-breaking law that Australia passed in 2021, which also triggered threats from Google and Facebook to curtail their services. Both eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after amendments to the legislation were offered.

Since the Australian law took effect, the tech firms have approved more than 30 deals with media outlets compensating them for content-generating traffic.

Canada's news industry has called for tighter regulation of tech companies to prevent them from elbowing news businesses out of the online advertising market. News industry says it has suffered financial losses as firms like Google and Meta steadily gain greater market share of online advertising revenue.

Google may be forced to remove links to news articles found in Canadian search results if the bill passes, its vice president of news Richard Gingras said in testimony to a Senate committee, citing an ""uncapped financial liability"" if it had to pay publishers for linking to their sites.

Meta would also end the availability of news content in Canada if the bill is passed as currently drafted, said Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta in Canada.

Ottawa's proposal is similar to a ground-breaking law that Australia passed in 2021, which also triggered threats from Google and Facebook to curtail their services. Both eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after amendments to the legislation were offered.

Google last year linked to Canadian news publishers more than 3.6 billion times, Gingras said, helping those companies make money on ads and new subscriptions.

Curran said Facebook feeds sent Canadian publishers more than 1.9 billion clicks in the 12 months ending April 2022, worth an estimated $230 million in free marketing.

""A framework that requires us to compensate publishers for links or news content they voluntarily put on our platforms is unworkable,"" Curran said.

The bill introduced in April 2022 by Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is the latest legislation aiming to make digital media platforms pay for linking news content.

""All we're asking the tech giants like Facebook and Google to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work,"" Heritage Ministry spokesperson Laura Scaffidi said.

That can happen now that Alphabet-owned Google has added passkeys as a password-free option for users. They can be implemented for personal Google Accounts, according to Google Security Blog post.

Access to the feature started as of Wednesday, giving users a new option over a password or two-step verification.

Google Account holders can make using their fingerprint, face recognition or a local PIN to unlock their device a method for logging in when using passkeys, per the blog post. The company said they help keep users safe from ""phishing and any accidental handling that passwords are prone to, such as being reused or exposed in a data breach.""

APPLE AND GOOGLE HIT BACK AT AIRTAG STALKING WITH NEW PROPOSED INDUSTRY SPECIFICATION

Storage of the passkey takes place on a userâs device, according to Google.

The company noted that passkeys are ""still new and it will take some time before they work everywhere."" In the meantime, plugging in a password or using another log-in method will stick around for personal Google Accounts.

The 36-year-old data-science specialist works in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most coveted experience on the planet after OpenAI demonstrated the breakthroughs of ChatGPT. Chopra, who works outside of New Delhi, sees friends in the field get pay hikes of 35% to 50% each time they switch jobs. âThereâs a real shortage of data and AI talent,â he said.

An AI hiring frenzy is ricocheting around the world, from Silicon Valley to Europe, Asia and beyond. While tech giants like Google and Baidu Inc. dangle top-notch packages for the engineers to build their own AI engines, companies in almost every other field â from health care and finance to entertainment â are staffing up too, to avoid getting blindsided by shifts in their industries.

India, perhaps more than any other country, illustrates how the rush for talent is outstripping supply. The country of 1.4 billion people has long been the back office for the tech industry, a source of reinforcements for any emergency. But now even the worldâs most populous nation is running out of the data scientists, machine-learning specialists and skilled engineers that companies are looking for.

Thereâs an âinsatiable need for talent,â said Rahul Shah, co-founder of WalkWater Talent Advisors, a headhunter for top-level workers. âAI canât be outsourced, itâs core to the organization.â

Recruitment stories verge on the absurd. In one search Shahâs firm just handled, the new employer more than doubled a candidateâs pay. Freedom Dumlao, chief technology officer of Flexcar, interviewed one engineer who said a rival suitor had offered him a BMW motorcycle as a sign-on bonus. âThatâs a line Iâm not comfortable approaching,â Dumlao said.

Indiaâs tech industry is built on a plentiful supply of affordable workers. Companies like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. invented the model for modern outsourcing, in which Western companies tap engineers halfway around the world to handle support, services and software, typically at a fraction of the cost of local workers. There are now more than five million people employed in tech services in India, according to the trade group Nasscom.

Powerhouses like Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. set up their own operations in India, hiring locals by the thousands. Google, now part of Alphabet Inc. started with five employees in the country in 2004 and now employs nearly 10,000.

But this seemingly endless supply of labor is running short in critical fields. There are about 416,000 people working in AI and data science in the country â- and demand for another 213,000, according to Nasscomâs estimates. âThe proportion of unfilled job roles is approximately 51% of the current installed talent base,â it said in a February report, flagging the crunch as a risk to growth.

Itâs likely to get worse. India added 66 tech innovation centers, so-called global capability centers or captives, last year taking the total to nearly 1,600. These GCCs that used to handle tasks like IT support and customer support have morphed into in-house centers for business-critical technology â like AI. In the first three months of 2023, asset manager AllianceBernstein Holding LP, car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc., entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. and aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney set up R&D hubs in Bangalore, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Walmart Inc.

âChatGPT has driven the larger domain of artificial intelligence out of stealth mode,â said Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of ANSR Consulting, which helps design and establish technology centers for corporations.

Last year, Dallas-headquartered ANSR set up 18 such captives in India; Ahuja expects that number to hit 25 this year. âMany enterprises which have India captives are accelerating their AI road map to derive a competitive edge.â

Companies large and small are trying to figure out how AI will affect their fates. Can ChatGPT predict future demand with newfound accuracy? Will deep learning technologies prove better at medical diagnosis than any doctor today? Could trading algorithms be fine-tuned to the point finance companies with the best technologies will drive their rivals out of business?

âThe talent crunch is going to worsen in the next year or two,â said Biswajeet Mahapatra, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc.

India has the second largest pool of highly-skilled AI, machine learning and big data talent, according to the February report by Nasscom, after the US. It produces 16% of the worldâs AI talent pool, placing it among the top three talent markets with the US and China.

Dumlao of Flexcar, a Boston-based car subscription startup, says thatâs not enough. He has been hunkering down in Bangalore for the past three months trying to assemble a team of data engineers and computer-vision specialists for the startupâs data science hub in the city. Flexcarâs team of 60 engineers helps build AI applications to automatically detect damage when vehicles are returned. The startup has embraced ChatGPT and is piloting a chatbot to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles by querying trained bots.

âBangalore has incredible data engineering talent and the AI talent hunt is only going to intensify,â said Dumlao. The tricky thing is to persuade prized engineers that his startup is their most attractive option. âThe freshest ideas and the newest innovations will sprout wherever thereâs a concentration of talent,â he said.

Dumlaoâs competitors come in all shapes and sizes. Chilean retailer Falabella SA is the first Latin American company to open a captive in India for data analytics, AI and machine learning. âWe have to compete with the best of the best,â said Ashish Grover, its Santiago-based chief information officer. The efforts are paying off: a personalized customer platform now accounts for over half the incremental sales from digital targeting. An AI-fueled recommendation engine has driven three times more conversions on its mobile app.

Home improvement retailer Loweâs Cos Inc.âs captive tech center in Bangalore helps embed AI into its products, and all its technology will be built âAI first,â said Ankur Mittal, managing director of Loweâs India. For instance, the teamâs predictive algorithms help decide pricing, and fine-tune search features on Lowes.com. The Bangalore hubâs AI-powered computer vision uses videos and imagery from store cameras to help address shoplifting and analyze store footfalls.

This being India, many workers are trying to retrain themselves to land a coveted job in AI. Data engineer Deepak Kapoor, who works for a startup called Thinkbumblebee Analytics, is studying up on computer vision and large language models to move into deep learning, where job opportunities are plentiful. He thinks he could easily double his salary in a city like Bangalore.

Mahapatra, Forresterâs adviser to global chief information officers, anticipates years of rising demand for skilled workers. India is certain to benefit from the rush to high employees who understand this new world.

âWe havenât even touched the tip of the AI iceberg,â he says.

By Sam Jabri-Pickett

TORONTO, May 3 (Reuters) - Google and Meta would withdraw access to news articles in Canada if legislation compelling internet companies to pay news publishers is passed, company executives told Canadian lawmakers on Wednesday.

Canada's proposed legislation would force platforms like Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc to negotiate commercial deals and pay Canadian news publishers for their content, part of a broader global trend to make tech firms pay for news.

Google may be forced to remove links to news articles found in Canadian search results if the bill passes, its vice president of news Richard Gingras said in testimony to a Senate committee, citing an ""uncapped financial liability"" if it had to pay publishers for linking to their sites.

Meta would also end the availability of news content in Canada if the bill is passed as currently drafted, said Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta in Canada.

Ottawa's proposal is similar to a ground-breaking law that Australia passed in 2021, which also triggered threats from Google and Facebook to curtail their services. Both eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after amendments to the legislation were offered.

This year, Google tested blocking some Canadian users' access to news as a potential response to the legislation, a move Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a ""terrible mistake.""

Google last year linked to Canadian news publishers more than 3.6 billion times, Gingras said, helping those companies make money on ads and new subscriptions.

Curran said Facebook feeds sent Canadian publishers more than 1.9 billion clicks in the 12 months ending April 2022, worth an estimated $230 million in free marketing.

""A framework that requires us to compensate publishers for links or news content they voluntarily put on our platforms is unworkable,"" Curran said.

The bill introduced in April 2022 by Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez is the latest legislation aiming to make digital media platforms pay for linking news content.

""All we're asking the tech giants like Facebook and Google to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work,"" Heritage Ministry spokesperson Laura Scaffidi said.

277,2023-06-05T11:11:28+00:00,You can now sign up for Microsoft's Bing without a waitlist,"Microsoft (MSFT) is already leading the generative AI discussion thanks to its partnership with OpenAI and Bing chatbot. And now the company is taking things a step further, rolling out a host of improvements to both Bing and the companyâs Edge browser, including opening Bing up to third-party developers.

In a press announcement early Thursday, Microsoft CVP Yusuf Mehdi announced that Bing, which is powered by OpenAIâs GPT-4 technology, is now available to the general public as an open preview. In other words, you can now use Bing without first having to sign up for a waitlist as long as you have a Microsoft account.

More important than making Bing available to the general public, though, is word that Microsoft is making it so third-party developers can build their own app plug-ins into the software. Microsoft is making Bing available to more users, and opening up the chat bot to third-party developers. (Image: Microsoft)

âFor example, if youâre researching the latest restaurant for dinner in Bing chat, it will leverage OpenTable to help you find and book a reservation,â Mehdi explained in a statement. âOr, with Wolfram|Alpha, you can create powerful visualizations and get answers to complex science, math, and human-curated data-based questions directly from Bing chat.â

The idea is to make Bing chat a kind of one-stop shop for search, allowing consumers to both ask questions and receive answers via text and images.

Mehdi says Bing is also expanding its existing Bing Image Creator, which is a part of Bing chat, to 100 more languages, opening up the app to far more users than before.

In the future, he says, youâll also be able to upload images to Bing chat and search for similar content.

In terms of basic capabilities, Bing is also adding the ability to go back to your chat history and pick up where you left off during a previous session. Youâll also be able to export and share your chats to other apps. Microsoft, though, didnât say which apps outside of Microsoft Word. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

According to Mehdi, Bing users have already taken part in 500 million chats with the bot in the 90 days since it went live. The app now has 100 million users and mobile app downloads have increased 4x.

Story continues

Still, Bing has just 2.79% global market share as of April, according to StatCounter. Google (GOOG, GOOGL)? 92.6%.

But Microsoft isnât looking to dethrone the search giant just yet. When discussing the potential for search, the company speaks in terms of market share percentages. When the company debuted Bing in February, Microsoft representatives said that every one percent of market share Bing can take from Google is worth $2 billion in revenue.

With Microsoft continuing to innovate on Bing, and Googleâs Bard still in a limited preview, the Windows maker could be backing its rival into a corner.

Google, however, kicks off its annual Google I/O developer conference on May 10. And you can be all but certain the company and CEO Sundar Pichai will have plenty to say about their AI efforts.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

In fact, he claims, he has been receiving such requests to talk every two minutes since he announced his resignation from Google so that he can speak freely about âthe dangers of A.I.â

Now, the Turing award-winning scientist often referred to as the âgodfather of artificial intelligenceâ has told the Guardian that he will share his wisdom with Bernie Sanders, Elon Musk and the White Houseâbut they might not like the advice he has to offer.

âThe U.S. government inevitably has a lot of concerns around national security. And I tend to disagree with them,â he said. âFor example, Iâm sure that the defense department considers that the only safe hands for this stuff is the U.S. defense departmentâthe only group of people to actually use nuclear weapons.â

The London-born pioneer added that as a âsocialistâ, heâs not on board with the âprivate ownership of the media and of the means of computationâ.

âIf you view what Google is doing in the context of a capitalist system, itâs behaving as responsibly as you could expect it to do,"" he said. ""But that doesnât mean itâs trying to maximize utility for all people: itâs legally obliged to maximize utility for its shareholders, and thatâs a very different thing.â

Hintonâs advice for policymakers

Itâs clear that the dangers of A.I. is a growing concern among the worldâs most powerful people and policymakers.

The chief executives of Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are today meeting with the White House to discuss how to ensure their A.I. products are safe before public release.

Story continues

Itâs why Elon Musk, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak and over 1,100 prominent technologists and artificial intelligence researchers are calling for a 6-month ban on any A.I. developments so that governments can catch up and put in place âgovernance systemsâ.

Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders recently proposed introducing a robot tax to mitigate âmillions of workersâ losing their jobs at the hands of billionaires.

Having spent decades researching deep learning and laying the groundwork for A.I., one might have expected Hinton to have some sage advice for policymakers on how to safely move forwards.

Unfortunately, even the âgodfather of artificial intelligenceâ is stumped for answers.

âIâm not a policy guy,â he told the Guardian. âIâm just someone whoâs suddenly become aware that thereâs a danger of something really bad happening. I wish I had a nice solution, like: âJust stop burning carbon, and youâll be OK.â But I canât see a simple solution like that.â

Why Hintonâs ânot that optimisticâ about the future

In 1972, Hinton began his career as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh, where he first started his research on neural networks, mathematical models that roughly mimic the workings of the human brain and are capable of analyzing vast amounts of data.

He and two of his students went on to launch DNNresearchâwhich Google acquired in 2013 for $44 millionâwhere their breakthrough Turing Award-winning research would ultimately pave the way for the creation of A.I. today.

Looking back over the past 50 years of his career, Hinton told the Guardian that heâs âbeen trying to make computer models that can learn stuff a bit like the way the brain learnsâ.

But it was only until âvery recentlyâ that he realized these âbig models are actually much better than the brainâ.

âWe need to think hard about it now, and if thereâs anything we can do,â he said while warning that itâs not looking promising.

âThe reason Iâm not that optimistic is that I donât know any examples of more intelligent things being controlled by less intelligent things,â he added.

âYou need to imagine something that is more intelligent than us by the same degree that we are more intelligent than a frog. Itâs all very well to say: âWell, donât connect them to the internet,â but as long as theyâre talking to us, they can make us do things.â

Apple (AAPL)

After the bell in the US, Apple will report its second-quarter earnings with investors expecting year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the first-quarter (Q1), as previously stated by the tech giant.

It said on its last earnings call that sales of Macs and iPads would probably fall by double digits as a result of the âchallengingâ economic environment.

Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6bn (Â£73.64bn) for the second-quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3bn it brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.

However, recent big tech earnings have so far managed to beat expectations. For example,

Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) all largely outperformed analystsâ estimates, despite pull backs in consumer and corporate spending.

âNone of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,â explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster.

âAnd the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,â Munster added.

Shell (SHEL.L)

Shares in Shell were up nearly 2% at the time of writing in morning London trade after the energy giant reported a positive financial update.

It posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $9.65bn, which beat analystsâ expectations for $8.14bn. It was also higher than its profit in the first-quarter of 2022 ($9.13bn), when Russia first invaded Ukraine.

Moreover, the oil giant kept its share buyback programme unchanged at $4bn over the next three months.

Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: âStrong trading amid the volatile price environment in Europe and America helped Shellâs earnings outpace analystsâ expectations and offset the impact of weaker oil and gas prices and lower refining margins. Its chemicals result also improved, driven by better margins thanks to lower utility and feedstock costs.

Story continues

âUnlike BP, Shell maintained its share buyback programme, returning further cash to shareholders. Over the past year though, shares in Shell are up around 7.5%, underperforming BP which is up nearly 18%,â she added.

PacWest (PACW)

Shares in US mid-sized lender PacWest plunged more than 50% on Wednesday after traders digested media reports of a potential sale.

PacWest has since confirmed that it has been approached by partners and investors â and also noted that it is considering selling strategic assets.

The group also sought to reassure investors by saying it had not suffered out-of-the-ordinary deposit outflows, unlike rival First Republic Bank which saw depositors withdraw $100bn.

âLess than two months ago, PacWest received a $1.4bn cash injection from Atlas SP Partners following the collapse of SVB, which sparked negative reverberations across the sector,â Victoria Scholar highlighted.

Furthermore, she noted how First Republic Bank was rescued by JPMorgan with the Wall Street lenderâs CEO Jamie Dimon saying this week that âthere may be another smaller oneâ ahead, referring to a risk of another potential banking collapse.

âPacWest is the latest lender to fall victim to the turmoil in the US mid-cap banking sector with worried investors either cutting their holdings or adding to short positions which has punished its share price. PacWest has a heavy focus on commercial real estate lending, which has suffered on the back of the Fedâs aggressive rate hiking path after the longstanding punchbowl of cheap money was removed,â she added.

PacWest stock has tumbled from a 52-week high of $34.68 to a low of $6.42 at yesterdayâs close.

Next (NXT.L)

Shares in fashion retailer Next rose 2.06% on Thursday morning on the FTSE 100 after traders were encouraged by its latest trading update.

The company maintained its guidance for annual profit after reporting a smaller decline in first-quarter sales of 0.7%, rather than the 2% fall it had expected, in the 13 weeks to 29 April.

The fashion retailer expects full year pre-tax profit to be Â£795m and earnings per share of 501.9p.

âWhile Nextâs latest sales update was moderately ahead of its prior expectations, it is nothing to get excited about. Sales growth has stalled and the only area where it is making decent gains is from the income attached to customer credit accounts,â Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.

Mould also noted that Next has a serious growth problem and said that while it may remain a profitable business, a company of its calibre is expected to show financial progression year after year.

âRepeated guidance for an 8.7% decline in full-year pre-tax profit suggests the business needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat to regain its mojo,â he added.

The company's cars will also start to pick up more volunteers for testing the autonomous vehicles traversing the more challenging conditions in San Francisco.

The expansion marks the next leg in an ambitious journey aimed at creating a safer and cheaper alternative to ride-hailing services that depend on humans.

The increased territory in the Phoenix area means Waymo's robotaxis will now pick up and drop off fare-paying passengers in an area spanning 180 square miles (466 square kilometers), doubling in size since late last year. Waymo's robotaxis now cover four times more territory than when they began giving rides to fare-paying passengers in the Phoenix area in late 2020.

âWe are feeling tremendous wind at our backs,â Saswat Panigrahi, Waymo's chief product officer, said in a briefing with reporters.

Waymo, which began as a secret project within Google more than a decade ago, is now hoping to carry that momentum into San Francisco, one of the most densely populated cities U.S. that is also renowned for hilly roads and frequent fog that can flummox driverless vehicles.

Although Waymo has encountered problems both with San Francisco's weather and unexpected stops that have blocked traffic, it's continuing to test its robotaxis throughout the city at all times of the day by providing free rides to its employees and volunteers called âtrusted testers.â

âThere are clearly additional learnings that we are responding to,â Panigrahi said of the various problems that Waymo has encountered in San Francisco.

The Mountain View, California, company is seeking approval from California regulators so its robotaxis can start charging fares for rides â something Cruise, a rival driverless service owned by General Motors, has been doing since last June, but only in parts of San Francisco during nighttime hours.

Story continues

Cruise also recently began giving free rides through most of San Francisco around the clock to volunteer passengers while waiting for state regulators to approve its application to collect fares for service anywhere in the city.

If and when Waymo and Cruise get regulatory approval, San Francisco will become the first U.S. city with two commercial robotaxi services competing against ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft, as well as traditional taxis with humans behind the wheel.

As part of Thursday's announcement, Waymo said its robotaxis are providing an average of 10,000 weekly rides with no humans inside the vehicles other than passengers. Panigrahi said he expects Waymo's robotaxi fleet to be giving 100,000 weekly rides by the summer of 2024."

The company has introduced a new feature for Gmail thatâs meant to warn people against scammers, letting companies verify their identities and adding the blue tick next to their name in peoplesâ inboxes.

The program is an expansion of Googleâs Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) initiative, which Google began testing in 2021. There is no charge for the feature.

âStrong email authentication helps users and email security systems identify and stop spam, and also enables senders to leverage their brand trust,â the company wrote in a blog post. âThis increases confidence in email sources and gives readers an immersive experience, creating a better email ecosystem for everyone.â

Hovering over the check mark will summon a popup for Gmail users, which reads âThe sender of this email has verified that they own [the domain it was sent from] and the logo in the profile image,â accompanied by a link for additional information.

The feature should be live for users by the end of the week.

Googleâs embrace of the blue check mark comes at a time where its meaning on Twitterhas become muddled. Once a signal that an account was authentic, it has become known as a âbadge of shame,â with some Twitter Blue subscribers (who pay $8 per month for the check) finding themselves ridiculed. (App researchers have even found evidence Twitter could be adding a toggle letting subscribers hide the check from view.)

Facebook, too, has added the feature, charging people $12 (or $15 on Apple and Google devices) for the badge. Reactions to that feature have been lukewarm as well, as critics say itâs just an attempt to buy clout.

By Nandita Bose and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden attended a White House meeting with CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft, on Thursday to discuss risks and safeguards as the technology catches the attention of governments and lawmakers globally.

Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, with apps such as ChatGPT capturing the public's fancy, sparking a rush among companies to launch similar products they believe will change the nature of work.

Millions of users have begun testing such tools, which supporters say can make medical diagnoses, write screenplays, create legal briefs and debug software, leading to growing concern about how the technology could lead to privacy violations, skew employment decisions, and power scams and misinformation campaigns.

Biden, who ""dropped by"" the meeting, has also used ChatGPT, a White House official told Reuters. ""He's been extensively briefed on ChatGPT and (has) experimented with it,"" said the official, who asked that they not be named.

Thursday's two-hour meeting which began at 11:45 am ET (1545 GMT), includes Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.

Harris said in a statement the technology has the potential to improve lives but could pose safety, privacy and civil rights concerns. She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.

Story continues

Ahead of the meeting, OpenAI's Altman told reporters the White House wants to ""get it right.""

""It's good to try to get ahead of this,"" he said when asked if the White House was moving quickly enough on AI regulation. ""It's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's one I'm sure we can handle.""

The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.

Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA Corp, OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems.

Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, the Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, which was built entirely with AI imagery.

Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.

United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deepfakes and misinformation.

""We don't see this as a race,"" the senior official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.

In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their AI use. The Biden administration has also released an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division also said they would use their legal authorities to fight AI-related harm.

Tech giants have vowed many times to combat propaganda around elections, fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines, pornography and child exploitation, and hateful messaging targeting ethnic groups. But they have been unsuccessful, research and news events show. (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons, Gerry Doyle and Jonathan Oatis)"

MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE WARNS AI WILL CAUSE âREAL DAMAGEâ IN THE WRONG HANDS

READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP

Hassabis' prediction comes just days after another top mind at Google quit the company to warn of the dangers of advancing AI too quickly. Geoffrey Hinton, a Google engineer widely considered the godfather of artificial intelligence, helped kicked off the AI craze in 2012 with a major breakthrough that led to AIs like ChatGPT.

Hinton now says he regrets his life's work.

""I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadnât done it, somebody else would have,"" he told the New York Times.

""It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,"" Hinton went on to say of AI.

Hinton said the progression seen since 2012 is astonishing but is likely just the tip of the iceberg.

""Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,"" he said of the industry. ""Take the difference and propagate it forwards. Thatâs scary."" Geoffrey Hinton, widely called the ""godfather of AI,"" quit Google to warn of the dangers of AI development.

Hinton's fears echo those expressed by more than 1,000 tech leaders earlier this year in a public letter that called for a brief halt to AI development. Hinton did not sign the letter at the time, and he now says that he did not want to criticize Google while he was with the company. Hinton has since ended his employment there and had a phone call with Google CEO Sundar Pichai last week.

But a much more immediate risk of A.I.âs rapidly accelerating scale could be that the technology will overwhelmingly benefit only a handful of powerful actors, according to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission and one of the countryâs loudest voices against corporate anti-competitiveness. And sheâs already on the case.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

A.I. as a widely available commercial product only really entered the public consciousness in November last year, when OpenAI released its hugely popular A.I.-powered ChatGPT. But Khan and the FTC are already seeing issues related to the nascent technology that threaten to undermine fair competition and harm consumers, she wrote in a guest essay published in the New York Times Wednesday.

âWhile the technology is moving swiftly, we already can see several risks,â Khan wrote, adding that widespread use of A.I. could entrench the status of tech behemoths that already play an outsize role in the economy.

âA handful of powerful businesses control the necessary raw materials that startups and other companies rely on to develop and deploy A.I. tools. This includes cloud services and computing power, as well as vast stores of data.â

Left unchecked, leading A.I. companies could dominate the industry much like todayâs Google, Meta, and Apple cornered the internet 20 years ago, Khan warned. But if antitrust regulators begin applying pressure now, she argued, we could instead move toward a rosier scenario like what happened when corporate giants such as IBM and AT&T gave up control decades agoâand sparked an economic boom.

Mounting antitrust threats

A.I.âs integration is happening fast, as companies including Google and Microsoft are locked in an arms race to corner the market in a global industry that could be worth nearly $16 trillion by 2030, according to PwC, a consulting firm.

The pace of change has a historical precedent, Khan wrote: The onset of the internet in the 1990s and early 2000s, and especially the emergence of social media and user-generated content online. That technological disruption was an opportunity that todayâs tech giantsâincluding Google, Meta, and Appleâseized, and Khan, a longtime advocate of sweeping antitrust reforms, has frequently targeted tech companies for perceived breaches of fair competition rules since becoming FTC chair in 2021. Khan wrote in her guest essay that the online services companies initially promised as free were eventually âmonetized through extensive surveillance,â a tradeoff that remains alive to this day.

While the antitrust rules of decades ago were mainly concerned with price fixing, when giants controlled prices while limiting competitorsâ say, Khan has been called a proponent of âhipster antitrust,â a school of antitrust that doesnât just consider price controls as a measure of anti-competitiveness, but also thinks about the structure of markets. So-called market structuralism keeps a small number of large companies at the top through several mechanisms including political influence and swallowing up small potential competitors early on.

Khan notably wielded this interpretation of antitrust in a campaign against Meta that began last year, where she sued to block the acquisition of a tech startup that Meta saw as a puzzle piece in its larger metaverse vision.

A similar situation could be playing out with A.I., Khan warned. The space has so far been dominated by a small number of actors, primarily Google and Microsoft, the companies backing the most prolific A.I. labs in the world, DeepMind and OpenAI, respectively. She wrote that because A.I. will likely play a major role in price-setting, collusion between giants âunfairly inflatesâ costs, and could also lead to âtargeted price discrimination.â But she argues that the limited competitive pool also risks hurting the industryâs development.

A lack of government oversight and regulation could lead to A.I. being âtrained on huge troves of data in ways that are largely unchecked,â she continued, potentially enabling misinformation and facilitating the work of scammers in ways that threaten âturbocharging fraud.â

âThe history of the growth of technology companies two decades ago serves as a cautionary tale for how we should think about the expansion of generative A.I.,â Khan wrote, comparing the lack of A.I. oversight to the situation that enabled todayâs tech giants to dominate the internet. âAs the use of A.I. becomes more widespread, public officials have a responsibility to ensure this hard-learned history doesnât repeat itself.â

But if techâs consolidation over the past 20 years is a warning about what to avoid, Khan looked even further back to find a blueprint for how to evade predictable pitfalls. Beginning in the 1960s, tough antitrust action coerced large tech companies to disclose the closely guarded inner workings of their success, in a lesson that Khan points to about how to âhandle technological disruption for the benefit of all.â

Cracking down on tech

Khanâs brand of hipster antitrust has plenty of critics, but she wrote in her essay that traditional antitrust action taken decades ago could be a road map for how the government approaches A.I.

Khan pointed to the case of computing titan IBM, which in 1969 was slapped with an antitrust lawsuit that would eventually lead to a legal battle lasting 13 years. At the time, IBM boasted 70% of the computer market share, and the government sought to split the giant into several smaller companies that could compete with one another. Under mounting government pressure, and as legal fees climbed in a case that involved nearly 1,000 witnesses, IBM unbundled its software from its hardware products, an act some commenters look back on as crucial to shaping the modern software industry, and that Khan said created âtrillions of dollars of growth.â

Another example cited by Khan was a 1974 antitrust case against telecommunications giant AT&T, which at the time was the worldâs largest privately owned company. A legal settlement in 1982 forced AT&T to divest its 23 local subsidiaries that enabled the companyâs monopoly over U.S. telecommunications.

The AT&T breakup led to a 19% increase in telecommunications patenting between 1981 and 1990, while the number of new patents between 1970 and 1981 largely stayed the same or even decreased, according to a study published last year by CEPR, a European economic think tank. The antitrust crackdown âunleashed decades of innovation and spurred the expansion of countless young firms,â Khan wrote.

Lawmakers have largely taken a slow approach to setting the rules around A.I., with some experts saying that the tech is advancing much faster than most policymakers can keep up with.

Secrets behind companiesâ rapid advancements in A.I. have also so far remained protected. Even OpenAI, the startup that was originally founded with the mission of democratizing A.I. for all to benefit, has been largely private about the finer details of its latest systems, notably eliciting the scorn of cofounder Elon Musk, who has since gone on to announce his own rival A.I. startup called TruthGPT.

But the urgency of staying in control of the A.I. industry has not been lost on some government officials. On Thursday, the White House unveiled new measures to ensure A.I. research in the U.S. incorporates ethics and that companies were following best practices to ensure the public equally benefits from the technology. Also on Thursday, President Biden reportedly organized a meeting with CEOs of leading A.I. companies to discuss implementing the measures.

The U.K. announced similar action on Thursday, when the governmentâs Competition and Markets Authority announced a sweeping review of the countryâs A.I. industry, examining whether markets will remain competitive and if the ârapidly scaling technologyâ threatens to undermine consumer protection laws.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday accused patent owner Arendi S.A.R.L. of revealing secret information about a settlement agreement between them, including how much Apple paid, during Arendi's separate infringement trial against Alphabet's Google LLC.

Apple asked a Delaware federal judge to impose monetary sanctions against Arendi and its law firm Susman Godfrey one day after Google defeated Arendi's $45.5 million lawsuit at the trial, which did not involve Apple.

Arendi's attorneys and representatives for Apple and Susman Godfrey did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.

Arendi has sued several tech companies over its patents, which relate to retrieving information such as names and addresses from a database and entering it into word processors and spreadsheets. It sued Apple in 2012 and Google in 2013, accusing their mobile devices of violating the patents.

Apple settled with Arendi in 2021 under confidential terms. Apple's Wednesday filing said it attended the Google trial because it feared Arendi would misuse its confidential business information during the proceedings.

""And Plaintiff did just that,"" the filing said.

Apple said Arendi's damages expert disclosed the monetary terms of their settlement during questioning by Susman Godfrey partner Seth Ard, violating the companies' confidentiality agreement.

The company said Arendi and Susman Godfrey have ""strong motivations to push the envelope on 'inadvertently' disclosing Appleâs confidential information"" for ""the ultimate benefit of Plaintiff's licensing regime and Plaintiff's counsel's litigation strategy.""

Susman Godfrey previously represented Arendi in other patent lawsuits against companies including Apple, Samsung and LG.

Apple asked the court to award an unspecified amount of fees for the ""flagrant violations.""

The year 2021 saw an unprecedented rise in quitting of jobs, now known as the Great Resignation, with over 47 million Americans saying goodbye to their jobs, primarily driven by retirement and a reconsideration of work-life balance. According to theÂ Harvard Business Review, this phenomenon was more prevalent among women and younger age groups experiencing burnout. Many employees changed jobs, either within the same or different sectors, while others expressed reluctance to return to the office due to Covid-related concerns.

The Great Resignation is not yet over, as US Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data issued in February reported that aroundÂ 50.5 million people quit their jobs in 2022. Therefore, it becomes more important than ever that we reassess the qualities that constitute a desirable workplace.

According to Glassdoor's list ofÂ Best Places to Work in 2023 in the USA, the industries that have high retention rates and rank high in employee satisfaction areÂ technology, finance, and consulting. The technology sector accounted forÂ 40%Â of the organizations on the list of top employers, withÂ sixÂ out of the top 10 highest-ranked employers being tech companies, emphasizing the industry's dominance in creating appealing workplaces. 20 Most Desirable Companies To Work For In USA

To further study what employeesâ expectations are in this day and age from their hiring companies,Â Bain conducted a survey of over 500 technology employees across 230 tech companies around the world. The survey revealed that approximately 66% of employees prefer a blend of remote and in-person work, and 46% would contemplate leaving an employer that did not provide flexible work arrangements. The research also found that companies that explicitly state their commitment to promoting diversity and fostering inclusivity are approximately twice as successful in attracting and retaining top tech talent. Moreover, over 80% of the respondents said that the ability to use cutting-edge technology is also a significant factor in their decision to stay at a workplace.

The engineer, Luke Sernau, published the document on an internal system at Google in early April. Over the past few weeks, the document was shared thousands of times among Googlers, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss internal company matters. On Thursday, the document was published by the consulting firm SemiAnalysis, and made the rounds in Silicon Valley.

In Sernauâs analysis, Googleâs rivalry with startup OpenAI had distracted from the rapid developments being made in open-source technology. âWeâve done a lot of looking over our shoulders at OpenAI. Who will cross the next milestone? What will the next move be?â he wrote. âBut the uncomfortable truth is, we arenât positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While weâve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch. Iâm talking, of course, about open source.â

Sernau did not respond to a request for comment.

As progress in generative artificial intelligence accelerates, employees at Google and other tech giants have engaged in spirited discussions internally and externally about the technology that is remaking their industry. Google, in particular, has come under pressure as the wild popularity of OpenAIâs chatbot ChatGPT has sparked concerns that the company may be losing its advantage in artificial intelligence, a field where it has long been a leader.

Story continues

Yet Sernau asserted that the real threat to Google is coming from open-source communities, where engineers are speedily advancing models that rival the quality of those at big tech companies, and can be made more cheaply. These models, he said, can be faster, more customizable and more useful than Googleâs own.

âWe have no secret sauce,â Sernau wrote. âOur best hope is to learn from and collaborate with what others are doing outside Google.â He expressed concern that clients would not be willing to pay for models with such high-quality technology on offer for free.

The spokesperson for Google did not provide a comment on the content of the post. In a recent earnings call, Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said, âOur investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well,â pointing to progress in developing models and working with developers and other partners. Pichai has called for AI regulation in the past, cautioning that the technology could be âvery harmful,â if not deployed in a thoughtful way.

In February, a large language model created by Meta leaked out into the open, jump-starting progress on generative AI in open-source forums. The model, known as LLaMA, is smaller than the models that Google and OpenAI have been touting, making it easier to work with; researchers currently have to apply to Meta to access LLaMA.

Google would do well to shift its focus to smaller more nimble models, Sernau argued. âGiant models are slowing us down,â the engineer wrote. âIn the long run, the best models are the ones which can be iterated upon quickly.â

(Reuters) - Sonos Inc and Alphabet's Google LLC will face off in a San Francisco federal trial on Monday over claims that Google copied Sonos' patented smart-speaker technology in wireless audio devices like Google Home and Chromecast Audio.

The case is part of a sprawling intellectual property dispute between the former business partners that includes other lawsuits in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands.

Sonos has asked the court for $90 million in damages from Google in the San Francisco case, down from $3 billion after U.S. District Judge William Alsup narrowed the case, according to a Google court filing. Sonos alleges Google infringed two of its patents related to multi-room wireless audio.

Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the case relates to ""some very specific features that are not commonly used,"" and that Sonos ""mischaracterized our partnership and technology.""

Sonos declined to comment on the dispute.

The companies previously worked together to integrate Google's streaming music service into Sonos products. Sonos first sued Google for patent infringement in Los Angeles and at the U.S. International Trade Commission in 2020, accusing the tech giant of copying its technology during their collaboration.

Sonos won a limited import ban on some Google devices from the ITC last year, which Google has appealed. Google has countered with its own patent lawsuits in California and at the ITC.

Alsup has had sharp words for both companies. Last month, he called their attacks on one another's expert testimony ""emblematic of the worst of patent litigation"" with ""much ink spilled for little purpose.""

In a 2020 order, he cited the ""enormous"" resources already expended on the dispute.

""By the end, our parties' legal bills will likely have been able to build dozens of schools, pay all the teachers, and provide hot lunches to the children,"" the judge wrote.

310,2023-06-01T11:41:00+00:00,Google founder Larry Page hit with subpoena in Jeffrey Epstein lawsuit,"Alphabet CEO Larry Page - AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File

Larry Page has been dragged into a lawsuit over JP Morganâs alleged relationship with Jeffery Epstein, after the billionaire Google co-founder was hit with a subpoena requesting any evidence of the disgraced sex offenderâs human trafficking.

A US judge granted permission for the US Virgin Islands to serve court papers on Mr Page, asking for him to disclose details of any personal dealings with Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex offences.

The subpoena demands access to âall documents reflecting or regarding Epsteinâs involvement in human trafficking and/or his procurement of girls or women for commercial sexâ.

It also asks for any documents from 2002 onwards relating to any alleged communications Mr Page may have had with Epstein, and any accounts he held or transactions he may have made with JP Morgan in relation to the paedophile financier.

The US Virgin Islands is suing Wall Street bank JP Morgan, alleging it is liable for facilitating Epsteinâs sex trafficking on Little St James, a private island he owned there, by ignoring red flags about the financier and providing him banking services. A view of Jeffrey Epstein's stone mansion on Little St. James Island - AP Photo/Gabriel Lopez Albarran

The US bank has denied wrongdoing and labelled the legal claims âmisdirected and deficientâ.

Mr Page is not the first high-profile figure to be pulled into the case. The island nation has also issued subpoenas to fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin and former Disney executive Michael Ovitz.

There is no indication they have done anything wrong.

The US Virgin Islands had also asked a US court for permission to hand Mr Page the subpoena through alternative means after having trouble finding him.

This could include emailing them or posting them online. CNBC first reported on the court filings.

The Caribbean nation claims that there was a âprofound friendshipâ between former JP Morgan executive Jes Staley and Epstein, and that the bank benefitted from its relationship with the convicted sex offender as he ran an alleged trafficking ring.

Story continues

Mr Staley is not a defendant in the lawsuit and has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged crimes committed by Epstein.

For years, Epstein, a Wall Street financier, courted relationships with billionaires and politicians. He was convicted of sex offences in 2008, and later arrested on further sex trafficking charges in 2019.

He committed suicide in his cell while awaiting trial.

Mr Page, who is worth around $95bn, is a director of Google-parent company Alphabet and its former chief executive. He also owned two islands in the US Virgin Islands as of 2022, according to Business Insider.

Pre-IPO companies are privately held companies that are in the process of preparing for an initial public offering (IPO). Investing in pre-IPO companies can offer better returns albeit with greater risks as the shares can potentially be bought at a lower price than they would be available once the company goes public.

The IPO activity hit record levels in 2021 with IPOs of nearly 2,400 companies across the globe to raise a combined total of $460 billion, according to an EY report. In comparison, 2022 witnessed a massive shrinkage in both deal volume as well as value as the IPO activity was recorded at only 1,333 IPOs, 45% lower year-on-year, with total proceeds of $179 billion, 61% lower than the previous year. The Americas region was the most heavily impacted region in terms of IPO activity as the figures dropped to a 13-year low by volume and a 20-year low by value with only 130 IPOs with proceeds of $9 billion, according to the report.

The decline can mostly be attributed to the significant volatility in the market caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, among other factors.Â The IPO market is expected to recover by the second half of the year as market volatility lowers and interest rates stabilize. A strong IPO pipeline has been built as multiple companies had to shelve their IPOs for future dates due to the prevalent market conditions.

Methodology

We have picked the 15 most valuable pre-IPO companies in the world by shortlisting companies that have either announced plans for IPOs in the recent future or are expected to file for IPOs based on the growth level of the company and industry dynamics. We took the valuation data for these companies from leading news websites as well as secondary market securities websites and used the companyâs own disclosures about pertaining to their valuations for corroboration.

The S&P 500 was up 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.8%, or 591 points lower, and the Nasdaq gained 2.4%.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose more than 3% after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, underpinned by strong iPhone sales in emerging markets.

Regional banking stocks Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), First Horizon National Corporation (NYSE:FHN), and PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) clawed back their losses from a day earlier, though some attributed the move to an oversold rally and suggest that it is too early to suggest the banking turmoil is over.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 235,000 in April, well above consensus expectations for 180,000 new jobs, though there were downside revisions to the prior March and February jobs reports.

The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell by 0.1% to 3.4%, while wages rose 0.5% for the month, topping estimates for 0.3%, pointing to the ongoing risk of a wage-led boost to inflation that will likely encourage the Fed to persist with higher for longer rates.

But not everyone on Wall Street is cheering the results and continue to view the company as a show me story,

Investors will be looking to the Oracle of Omaha and his quick-witted right-hand man Charlie Munger for reassurance amid recent turmoil in the banking industry. Even today, the pair of nonagenariansâ impact on investor confidence and the marketplace of ideas in economics remains palpable.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Luke Sernau, a senior Google engineer, made that clear when he referenced one of Buffett's most famous theoriesâthe economic moatâin an internal document released Thursday by the consulting firm SemiAnalysis, titled âWe have no moat. And neither does OpenAI.â In the document, which was published within Google in early April, Sernau claimed that the company is losing its artificial intelligence edge, not to the flashy, Microsoft-backed OpenAIâwhose ChatGPT has become a huge hit since its release last Novemberâbut to open-source platforms like Metaâs LLaMa, a large language model that was leaked to the public in February.

âWeâve done a lot of looking over our shoulders at OpenAIâ¦ But the uncomfortable truth is, we arenât positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While weâve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch,â he wrote. âIâm talking, of course, about open source. Plainly put, they are lapping us.â

Sernau did not respond to Fortuneâs request for comment, nor did Alphabet, Googleâs parent company.

The engineerâs claim ties back to Buffettâs idea that, like medieval castles, successful businesses must protect their cash cows with moats that keep competitors from making a credible challenge. Those moats can come in the form of a size advantage that helps reduce costs, patents that protect key technological innovations, a high cost to entry for competitors, or even brand recognition. The billionaire detailed his economic moat theory in a 1999 Fortune article:

Story continues

âThe key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.â

For decades, Googleâs search engine dominance, brand recognition, and technological edge have acted as a Buffett-style moat, enabling the company to stay ahead of the competition. But Sernau argued in his internal letter that this moat is now drying up as the artificial intelligence arms race heats up.

He explained that within a month of Metaâs LLaMa leak, independent researchers had already developed advanced models capable of writing emails and posting on social media.

âThe barrier to entry for training and experimentation has dropped from the total output of a major research organization to one person, an evening, and a beefy laptop,â he wrote. âWe have no secret sauce.â

Google introduced its ChatGPT competitor, Bard, in February, but the chatbot has been plagued by errors, which A.I. researchers have labeled âhallucinations,â since its release. The company said last month that it plans to add Bard to its search engine to compete with Microsoftâs Bing, which now uses ChatGPT, but so far it has yet to make the move.

Sernau argued in his letter that Google shouldnât be so focused on competing with ChatGPT: Instead, it should open its A.I. platform to the public and allow anyone to create their own applications with it in order to prevent the competition from gaining an edge.

âThe more tightly we control our models, the more attractive we make open alternatives,"" he wrote. âOur best hope is to learn from and collaborate with what others are doing outside Google.â

Finally, the engineer argued that consumers will only pay for closed models like ChatGPT or Googleâs Bard while theyâre free, because open-source alternatives are now âcomparable in quality.â

âWe should consider where our value add really is,â he wrote.

320,2023-05-31T21:01:59+00:00,Apple isnât playing the AI hype game,"Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected quarterly sales on Thursday, scoring another win for Big Tech this earnings season. Unlike his fellow CEOs, however, Appleâs Tim Cook didnât use his opening remarks to focus on his companyâs AI efforts.

In fact, Cook didnât mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisseâs Shannon Cross, who asked for Cookâs thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.

It was a stark contrast to the earnings calls for Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook parent Meta (META) during which their respective CEOs repeatedly talked up their various AI efforts. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures during the inauguration of India's first Apple retail store in Mumbai, India, April 18, 2023. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called out AI 31 times in his opening remarks during the companyâs earnings call last week, hitting on how the technology is impacting everything from the firmâs productivity and enterprise apps to the new Bing.

Alphabetâs Sundar Pichai uttered the letters AI a whopping 34 times in his own earnings call remarks, calling out his companyâs work to implement AI into its productivity and advertising offerings. He also, naturally, mentioned how Google will soon bring generative AI to its search business.

Then thereâs Metaâs Mark Zuckerberg. The CEO, who according to a Reuters report was caught flat footed in adopting the necessary AI hardware and software to power his companyâs growth, talked up AI 22 times in his earnings remarks.

Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cookâs Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. Itâs not as though Apple doesnât use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.

Cook specifically called out the companyâs use of the technology to power the Apple Watchâs fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

âIt's absolutely remarkable,â Cook said. âAnd so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.â

Story continues

Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.

But Appleâs ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, donât expect the company to dwell on the fact that itâs doing so.

If anything, youâll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.

However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.

321,2023-05-31T20:18:21+00:00,Time to Buy Alphabet and Amazon Stock After Q1 Earnings,"Technology conglomerates Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) havenât seen the extensive rallies in their stocks like in years past but more upside may be ahead.

Letâs see why now may be a good time to buy these tech giantsâ stocks after their first-quarter earnings last week.

Alphabet Q1 Review

Reporting Q1 earnings last Tuesday, Alphabet was able to put some of the fears that the companyâs slower progress in ChatGPT would affect its search engine dominance. CEO Sundar Pichai stated the Search segment was performing well along with momentum in the Cloud segment.

This led to Q1 sales rising 3% from the prior year quarter at $58.06 billion which topped estimates by 1%.

On the bottom line, first-quarter earnings nicely beat estimates by 10% at $1.17 per share despite dipping -5% from Q1 2022. More importantly, Alphabet put an end to a string of four consecutive quarters in which the company missed its bottom-line expectations. Zacks Investment Research

Amazon Q1 Review

Amazon also had a solid first quarter after releasing its results last Thursday. The multi-operational behemoth expects slower cloud revenue growth at the moment but Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales were still up 16% YoY at $21.35 billion. Total sales for the quarter topped estimates by 2% at $127.35 billion and increased 9% from Q1 2022.

Earnings widely topped expectations by 47% at $0.31 per share compared to EPS estimates of $0.21. This was also a 47% increase from the prior year quarter with Q1 2022 earnings at $0.21 per share. Zacks Investment Research

Growth & Outlook

Alphabet and Amazonâs better-than-expected first-quarter results are reason to be optimistic about their outlooks and the possibility that operating conditions may begin to stabilize.

To that point, Alphabet earnings are now forecasted to climb 18% this year and jump another 16% in FY24 at $6.25 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last 30 days and are nicely up over the last quarter.

Story continues

On the top line, sales are projected to be up 6% in FY23 and rise another 10% in FY24 to $274.53 billion. Fiscal 2024 would represent 69% growth from pre-pandemic sales of $161.85 billion in 2019. Zacks Investment Research

Turning to Amazon, earnings are expected to continue to rebound and soar 117% in FY23 at $1.54 per share compared to EPS of $0.71 in 2022. Plus, FY24 EPS is forecasted to climb another 52% to $2.35 per share. Earnings estimates revisions have trended higher in the last week since Amazonâs Q1 report.

Sales are projected to rise 9% this year and jump another 12% in FY24 to $629.96 billion. Furthermore, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 124% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $280.52 billion. Zacks Investment Research

Takeaway

Simply put, Alphabet and Amazonâs first quarter reports started to reconfirm the tech giants anticipated annual growth and that inflationary concerns could potentially subside in the near future. Both tech giants currently land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as higher earnings estimate revisions are also supportive of buying shares right now.

With Alphabet and Amazon stock both trading around $105 a share itâs starting to look more plausible that they will move closer to their Average Zacks Price Targets over the course of the year which are notably over $130 per share respectively.

The move comes as artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as ChatGPT are rapidly gaining in popularity, highlighting a technology that could upend the way businesses and society operate.

The tech giant will nudge its service further away from ""10 blue links,"" which is a traditional format of presenting search results and plans to incorporate more human voices as part of the shift, the report said.

At its annual I/O developer conference in the coming week, Google is expected to debut new features that allow users to carry out conversations with an AI program, a project code-named ""Magi,"" WSJ added, citing people familiar with the matter.

327,2023-05-31T15:56:12+00:00,"Artificial intelligence poses greater threat than climate change, says former Google scientist","Julian Simmonds - Julian Simmonds/Daily Telegraph

Artificial intelligence may pose a âmore urgentâ threat to humanity than climate change, according to one of Googleâs former top computer scientists.

Geoffrey Hinton, known as the âGodfather of AIâ, resigned from Google earlier this year to âspeak freelyâ about the risks posed by increasingly intelligent machines.

Mr Hinton, 75, has now warned powerful AI poses a more immediate to humanity risk than global warming.

The computer science professor said: âI wouldnât like to devalue climate change. I wouldnât like to say, âyou shouldnât worry about climate changeâ. Thatâs a huge risk too.

âBut I think this might end up being more urgent.â

Speaking to the Reuters news agency, Mr Hinton said: âWith climate change, itâs very easy to recommend what you should do: you just stop burning carbon. If you do that, eventually things will be okay. For this itâs not at all clear what you should do.â

It comes after technology leaders including Sam Altman, the boss of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, as well as the chief executives of Google and Microsoft were summoned to the White House to discuss the risks of AI on Thursday.Â 

The London-born computing expert helped pioneer so-called âmachine learningâ techniques in the 1980s and won the prestigious Turing Award in 2018.

These techniques underpin a powerful new wave of AI bots, such as ChatGPT, a chatbot that can provide convincingly-human sounding responses. Google is also building its own powerful bots, as are tech giants Facebook and Microsoft. Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton poses at Google's Mountain View, Calif, headquarters - Noah Berger/AP

The hope is these machines could accelerate the work of millions of people and eliminate menialÂ officeÂ tasks.

These digital agents are trained on millions of pages of text from the whole internet and hundreds of thousands of books.

The models can also absorb millions of pictures and videos to generate lifelike, but fake, images, films and music.

Technologists are increasingly wary these new bots could give rise to the emergence of a so-called âartificial general intelligenceâ that can surpass human intellect. There are also fears they could unleash a new wave of digitally created disinformation.

In an interview with the New York Times earlier this week, Mr Hinton warned that there was a risk that âbad actorsâ could use such powerful AI for âbad thingsâ, and that machines that can improve themselves or set their own goals without human supervision pose an existential risk.

Story continues

He has cautioned of the catastrophic impact such technology could have uncontrolled in the hands of world leaders such as Vladimir Putin and warned it may replace vast numbers of jobs.

Mr Hinton studied at Kingâs College, Cambridge in the 1970s before securing a PhD from Edinburgh University for his work on artificial intelligence. He is currently a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto.

He joined Google in 2013, helping design algorithms for increasingly intelligent machines.

The scientist predicted this week machines would surpass humans in intelligence within âfive to 20 yearsâ.

Writing in an open letter in March, more than a thousand technologists, including the worldâs second richest man Elon Musk, demanded a pause to the most advanced AI research over claims ever more advanced tools could âoutnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace usâ. Elon Musk - Reuters

The letter warned AI labs were locked in an âout-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital mindsâ.

Mr Hinton said pausing AI research was ""unrealistic"", but said the emerging technology posed ""existential risk"". He said: ""Itâs close enough that we ought to be working very hard right now, and putting a lot of resources into figuring out what we can do about it.âÂ 

Other AI experts, however, have questioned the likelihood of an all-powerful AI emerging soon.

Speaking to the Telegraph this week, Jerome Pesenti, the former head of artificial intelligence at Facebook-owner Meta, said âdoomsday scenariosâ were based on âlazy reasoningâ.

He added there were still âreal problems with AI todayâ, such as copyright and privacy breaches and racial bias in algorithms.

Mr Pesenti said: âInstead of warning everybody on Twitter or signing letters telling everybody else to stop working on AI, why donât these people stop what they are currently doing and start addressing these issues?â

He added: âWhat's sure is that the best way to influence what AI will do to humanity in the distant future is to make sure we fix the known problems of today.â

328,2023-05-31T15:52:18+00:00,Charlie Munger on AI: 'I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well',"Legendary investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger arenât fully sold on artificial intelligence.

While AI has become a major buzzword in first quarter earnings calls and the catalyst for a tech rally to start 2023, Buffett, 92, and Munger, 99, argue it might be not as revolutionary as some are making it out to be.

""I am personally skeptical of some of the hype that has gone into artificial intelligence,"" Munger said at the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) annual meeting. ""I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well.""

AI has taken center stage on Wall Street since OpenAI launched the latest version of ChatGPT in late November. Since then, tech companies have grown increasingly interested in AI as ChatGPT became the fastest-growing app on record, and stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and C3.ai. (AI) have skyrocketed.

AI has been the focus of earnings calls as tech companies wage an AI war on one another. Alphabet said its AI efforts lost $3.3 billion during the first quarter while Microsoft believes it can help it win market share amid âa generational shift in search.â

Microsoft has risen as a leader in the space, investing $10 billion in OpenAI. And the company's founder, Bill Gates, recently presented some of the companyâs AI technology to Buffett.

""It did these remarkable things but it couldnât tell jokes,"" Buffett said. ""Bill told me that ahead of time and prepared me. But it just isnât there."" Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, left, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates play table tennis against prodigy Ariel Hsing in Omaha, Neb., Sunday, May 1, 2016. (AP Photo/John Peterson)

Although there's been considerable excitement over AI, the prospects for the technology havenât been viewed entirely positively. A group of famed tech founders penned a letter warning of the dangers of AI, and just last week, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said AI could replace nearly 8,000 jobs at the company.

Buffett likened the disruptive nature of AI to the atomic bomb, which the United States used to ultimately bring an end to World War II. Buffett described the war tactic as necessary but questioned: ""Is it good for the next 200 years of the world?""

Story continues

âWhen something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried because now we wonât be able to un-invent it,"" Buffett said. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett (left) and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are seen at the annual Berkshire shareholder shopping day in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 3, 2019. REUTERS/Scott Morgan

Just as Munger and Buffett have been unimpressed with other trendy stock plays like cryptocurrency, which Munger called a ""venereal disease,"" Berkshire Hathway likely wonât be going all in on AI just yet.

""With AI, it can change everything in the world, except how men think and behave,"" Buffet said. ""And that's a big step to take.""

335,2023-05-31T09:15:00+00:00,Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trading At A 34% Discount?,"Key Insights

Alphabet's estimated fair value is US$160 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$106 suggests Alphabet is potentially 34% undervalued Analyst price target for GOOGL is US$131 which is 18% below our fair value estimate

How far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Alphabet

The Method

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate

2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$70.8b US$84.9b US$99.8b US$114.6b US$130.2b US$141.7b US$151.4b US$159.6b US$166.7b US$172.9b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x15 Analyst x15 Analyst x9 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 8.86% Est @ 6.83% Est @ 5.42% Est @ 4.43% Est @ 3.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5%  US$65.3k US$72.1k US$78.2k US$82.8k US$86.7k US$87.0k US$85.7k US$83.3k US$80.2k US$76.7k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$798b

Story continues

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$173bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (8.5%â 2.1%) = US$2.8t

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8tÃ· ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$1.2t

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$106, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf

Important Assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.070. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Alphabet

Strength

Debt is not viewed as a risk.

Weakness

Earnings declined over the past year.

Opportunity

Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.

Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Next Steps:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

From a macro perspective, investors have deep-rooted concerns about the current stock market, including a potential looming recession, stubborn inflation, a debt crisis, geopolitical escalations, and more. Small-cap stocks within the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM) have dragged as regional banking stocks within the SPDR Regional Bank ETF (KRE) continue to struggle.

However, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out. Zacks Investment Research

Despite a rough period of outperformance in 2022, itâs easy to see why investors are anxious to get exposure to the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ). Over the past 20 years, the returns have been stellar from both a total return and a relative basis. Since 2003, the QQQ has returned 982.8% versus just 541.5% for the S&P 500 Index. Zacks Investment Research

Though tech has dominated in 2023, not all tech stocks are created equally. For example, former high-flying, lesser-quality tech stocks such as Block (SQ) and Zoom (ZM) are still stuck in downtrends. Conversely, stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have performed so well that they now account for nearly 14% of the S&P 500 Index â the highest weighting for two companies in at least 40 years. So, itâs clear - investors are gravitating toward large-cap, institutional quality stocks with loads of cash.

While stocks like AAPL, MSFT, and Shopify (SHOP) have performed well, new buyers looking to enter tech need to be strategic and not chase stretched charts. Below are three high-quality tech stocks setting up:

My first pick is Alphabet (GOOGL). One of my favorite indications that a position will move higher occurs when a stock can shake off bad news quickly. My thinking is that if bad news is no news, no news should equate to good news.

Story continues

In early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the companyâs stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Qâs but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months. Zacks Investment Research

My next choice is Oracle (ORCL). Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.

Despite Oracleâs massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as âsexyâ as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume. Zacks Investment Research

When discussing dominance and quality in the software space, it is impossible to leave out Salesforce (CRM). Salesforce is the worldâs leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) company. Though CRMâs earnings growth slowed briefly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, the company is beginning to reap the benefits of its recent acquisition spree. Over the past few years, CRM has acquired Microsoft Teams competitor Slack, Tableau, ClickSoftware, and Mulesoft. Furthermore, key strategic partnership agreements with Alphabet and Amazon (AMZN) have helped the company to bolster growth. Last quarter, earnings growth rocketed by 100% year-over-year.

Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRMâs P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years. Zacks Investment Research

Technically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.

Artificial intelligenceâs big bang moment is here â and it will bring a lot of money to those who get it right.

As scientists and ethicists argue over whether the advent of advanced chatbots will usher in a new industrial revolution or the end of humanity itself, the businesses developing AI are rushing to put it in everything they can.

Microsoft is at the front of the race. The PC-pioneer was quick to back OpenAI, the start-up behind transformational software ChatGPT. The Bill Gates-founded company signed a deal to use OpenAIâs technology in its Bing search engine and reportedly invested $10bn (Â£7.95bn) in the company.

ChatGPT offers Microsoft a chance to leapfrog Google in search, but the technology offers far more than just that. Chief executive Satya Nadella has said AI will shape everything the company does in future.

During an unexpectedly sunny visit to Microsoftâs usually rain soaked campus in Redmond, Washington, executives demonstrate ways in which they hope AI will boost its business.

One example: the technology has been plugged into its Powerpoint software to help office workers complete hours of work on presentations in minutes.

A series of bullet points fed to Copilot â Microsoftâs name for its AI chatbot integrations â result in the creation of an entire slide deck, complete with stock images, corporate branding and even the right colour scheme. Full sentences extrapolated from the terse bullet points garnish each slide.

Walter Sun, the companyâs vice president of AI for business applications, believes Copilot could even become an âautopilotâ by 2028. Rather than tasking a human to oversee the creation of a slide deck with the help of AI, an executive could simply ask software directly to do all the legwork.

âWe start by shipping features where there's a human in the loop to make sure everything works,â says Sun. âMaybe in five years, these things will become more self-service. I think itâs possibleâ.

Copilot was first trialled commercially on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned collaboration website for software developers. Instead of humans writing code and then posting it to GitHub for others to critique (and borrow from), Microsoft used the GPT programme to create a virtual assistant capable of writing software code all by itself in response to user prompts.

AI assistants within Microsoftâs products will become ubiquitous, writing code, emails and Powerpoint presentations for people why they deal with less automatable tasks such as meetings and presentations.

However, limiting the role of humans in day-to-day business raises knotty questions.

âThe question is, are we designing PowerPoint in a way that takes away my agency, my humanity?â asks Frank Shaw, the companyâs marketing chief. âOr are we empowering them to spend more time on the parts that matter?â

It is also an ominous portent for white collar workers. Just as advances in machinery have left scores of blue collar workers on the sidelines over the past century, AI could make many office jobs of today redundant.

IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna recently said that thousands of back office staff are likely to be âreplaced by AI and automation over the next five yearsâ. The company is stopping hiring in some areas and investing in software instead.

Connor Axiotes, a researcher at think tank the Adam Smith Institute, believes mass adoption of AI will lead to higher levels of unemployment in a way that no other past technologies have.

âFuture AI systems will have superhuman labour abilities, be smarter than humans, and encroach on a domain that no transformative technology ever has â cognitive labour,â he says.

âThat part of working ability which has been humanity's comparative advantage will no longer be so. This is why I think, more than ever, we are likely to see these stickier kinds of unemployment.â

Jon Friedman, Microsoftâs corporate vice president of design and research, is sanguine.

âIn every age in the history of technology, the thing that we thought was going to replace human jobs created more human jobs,â he says.

Microsoftâs representatives are keen to stress that the company wants to âaugmentâ what people can do with AI instead of replacing them outright. Yet it is difficult to ignore the potential for AI to destroy jobs, even in its current state.

Even as tech companies plough ahead, thereâs the question of whether AI is good enough to do the job in the first place.

During the Copilot trial on GitHub, one software developer complained that the AI sometimes âsuggests things that are just wrongâ. Another said using the product was akin to âhaving to deal with a trainee programmer who knows how to search on Googleâ â not a glowing endorsement.

ChatGPT has a well documented tendency to âhallucinateâ: produce convincing-sounding answers to questions that are in fact wrong. Plagiarism is also an issue when it comes to creating new material such as code or Powerpoint presentations.

Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computer Society, says that AI programmes such as ChatGPT are âonly as good as the source of dataâ used to train them.

He warns: âIf somebody intentionally starts to poison some of the data sources, without you knowing about it, then that can create all kinds of ramifications, right?

âWe're all super excited about what can be done without really thinking through the potential risks.â

Some people are: hundreds of tech leaders including Tesla chief executive Elon Musk penned a recent letter calling for a moratorium on AI development until the risks were properly understood. Meanwhile, Â the âGodfather of AIâ Geoffrey Hinton recently quit Google with a warning that AI was on the verge of becoming dangerously powerful.

Ciaran Martin,Â the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, has warned the technology ârisks undermining the fabric of our societyâ by making the spread of convincing fake news so easy.

At Microsoft, writing PowerPoint presentations appears a long way off the downfall of humanity. May0078295 The Daily Telegraph AI - Artificial Intelligence - Toronto, Ontario Canada.

The company is keen to press ahead with its advantage in AI, hoping to gain a crucial edge over rivals including Google and Amazon. If it does not, it risks falling behind.

The cost of losing ground should not be underestimated.Â Google, whose experiments with AI have been lower-profile, saw $120bnÂ wiped off its shares after a botched demo of its own chatbot, Bard, showed it giving a wrong answer.

Professor Mike Wooldridge of the Alan Turing Institute says: âWhat we're seeing is a massive pivot in Big Tech towards this technology, because this finally delivered a mass market product for AI.

âThey're all broadly in the same sort of ballpark... But OpenAI and Microsoft have basically got a year's head start.â

OpenAI ultimately aims to create âartificial general intelligenceâ (AGI), regarded by most researchers as the fieldâs Holy Grail: the creation of true machine consciousness. AGI would allow machines to essentially think for themselves and this breakthrough moment could be reached within years, some in the field believe.

It is AGI that pessimists are most worried about. Once machines can be set off to complete tasks with relative autonomy, how can we control what they do? Thought experiments abound about how relatively simple commands could lead to the end of humanity.

Would Microsoft adopt AGI if OpenAI creates it?

âHonestly, I donât know,â Eric Boyd, the companyâs corporate vice president of AI platform technology, says in Redmond. It is difficult to speculate âon this thing that doesnât existâ, he says.

However, Boyd adds: âI canât imagine we wouldnât take advantage of some really advanced technology.â"

Here's Why Tech Investors Shouldn't Panic.,"The latest batch of quarterly earnings reports from the top cloud computing companies indicated an unnerving trend: Spending from cloud clients is slowing down. Investors are already concerned about rising interest rates and a potential recession, so hearing management from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) say that customers are somewhat backing off of cloud spending right now didn't exactly instill confidence. You'd have to ignore some really huge cloud computing trends to think the market is on the decline.

344,2023-05-26T18:32:55+00:00,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Shopify","For Immediate Release

Chicago, IL â May 8, 2023 â Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Shopify Inc. SHOP.

Here are highlights from Fridayâs Analyst Blog:

Why Are Tech Stocks Doing So Well This Year?

The tech sector is up more than 18% this year, more than double the S&P 500's roughly 7%.

But this is a huge sector, with many different kinds of companies offering very different kinds of products and services to often different markets. Therefore, it's difficult to come up with common factors that drive the sector.

Until you look at the market capitalization of some of these companies. Alphabet, for instance, with its market cap of over $1.3 trillion, has a much greater impact on the sector's performance when it rises around 19% year to date than, say, BigBear.ai Holdings, although this stock has soared 285%+. The same can be said of Microsoft, with its market cap of over $2.2 trillion (up nearly 27% year to date), or of Meta Platforms with its $614 billion market cap (up 94%) or Shopify with its $59 billion (up 65%).

The point is that this is a sector with some very large cap stocks that skew the average whenever they make big moves. Since they have been making big moves this year, it makes sense to see why.

The biggest reason perhaps is the stabilization in the interest rate. As inflation rates continue to moderate, the markets have been expecting the Fed to stop raising rates. After the latest hike, the Fed has indicated that there may not be further hikes this year. Rate hikes are a problem for most growth stocks because these are the riskiest assets. Investors put their money into these stocks in the hopes that they'll get outsized returns at some future date.

Story continues

Technology companies may be younger or mature, but by their very nature, they invest huge capital in futuristic innovations that may or may not generate the anticipated returns. Therefore, when higher rates make less risky assets more attractive, some investors switch to those. Additionally, tech companies may also take a certain amount of debt to fund their R&D. Stabilization in the interest rate therefore makes these stocks more attractive.

Another reason for the big moves is the effect of the pandemic. In the initial phase of the pandemic, the rapid digitization generated huge business for some of these players. This pulled in five years of demand (by some estimates). As a result, demand dropped drastically in the following period, a situation that persists today, in some segments. Given the disappointing outlook, tech stocks plunged last year, making them more attractive from a valuation perspective.

The third reason, and this is specific to the larger cap tech stocks, is that although they invest humongous amounts of cash in their future innovations, they also have certain existing products that are pretty much like cash cows, generating year upon year of solid revenue and cash flows, as in the case of any good quality mature company.

Unlike mature players in certain other sectors, these stocks don't pay dividends. Or, just a handful of them â like Apple â do. They tend to pour the whole thing back into the business and maintain large cash balances for financial flexibility. This makes them attractive in times of uncertain demand, especially the mild recession/soft landing that most analysts are anticipating.

So, let's take a closer look at some of these big tech stocks:

Alphabet Inc.

Search giant Alphabet posted strong numbers last quarter, exceeding revenue estimates by 1.5% and earnings estimates by 10.4%. In the past month, the company's 2023 earnings estimate increased 3.9% while the 2024 estimate increased 2.0%. Revenue and earnings are expected to increase an estimated 6.1% and 18.2% this year and 10.6% and 16.1%, respectively in the next.

Microsoft Corp.

A provider of computer software, productivity solutions, search, cloud infrastructure services and more, Microsoft is easily one of the most attractive players right now. In the last quarter, Microsoft's earnings surprise of 10.4% came on top of a revenue surprise of 3.8%. Analyst estimates for the years ending June 2023 and 2024 have increased 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively. Its revenue is expected to increase 6.3% this year and 10.3% in the next. Earnings are expected to increase 4.3% and 12.1%, respectively.

Meta Platforms, Inc.

Social media provider Meta posted a sales surprise of 4.2% in the last quarter, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 34.7%. In the last 30 days, its 2023 earnings estimate has increased 12.6% and 2024 estimate 13.2%. Analysts currently expect revenue growth of 8.6% this year and 10.8% in 2024. Earnings are expected to grow 19.6% and 24.3%, respectively.

Shopify Inc.

Shopify provides an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company's March quarter earnings surprise of 50% came on top of revenues that surprised by 4.9%. Analysts have merely fine-tuned their estimates on this company's revenue and earnings, which are expected to grow 18.1% and 25%, respectively in 2023 and 21.6% and 395.8%, respectively the following year.

Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rating on Meta shares and a #2 (Buy) rating on the others.

345,2023-05-26T14:42:48+00:00,Google set to launch foldable Pixel smartphone,"Yahoo Financeâs Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the expectations for Google I/O 2023, an annual developer conference held by Google in Mountain View, CA.

Video Transcript

[AUDIO LOGO]

JULIE HYMAN: AI is the technology expected to take center stage at this year's Google I/O meetup, after that company's dramatic shift in focus. All this alongside the usual new hardware, like the first foldable Google Pixel smartphone. Here with more, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. I imagine, in regular times, that would be the exciting thing would be the foldable phone.

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah, you would think that would be the most exciting announcement if this was regular times. But AI really going to be the star of the show at Google I/O. And you know, just to be clear, they always show off some kind of AI technology. But this time around, they're responding directly to Microsoft's own push into generative AI with their OpenAI partnership. That's resulted in their new Bing search engine and their push to try to steal market share from Google. So we're gonna see more discussion about generative AI this time around than we have at any other point.

Likely, we'll hear conversation about how Google is going to start putting that kind of technology into its search product. So they've discussed how they want to do that. In the past, they announced their Bard AI chatbot. That's in limited preview, so maybe we'll get that available to everyone at some point. And then the search aspect and how generative AI would go into search.

But then, as you said, we have those phones also coming. There's the foldable that, you know, looks really, really interesting. They showed it off in a tweet. And I mean, we have seen foldable phones from competitors, like Samsung, but this one looks like it's got a few differences from the Samsung foldable to make it interesting, though. To be honest, I'm still not totally sold on a foldable phone yet.

JULIE HYMAN: Mhm.

Story continues

- Yeah. Huawei had the Mate X as well. So there have been folding phones out there, Dan. I mean, you and I have had this conversation. I'm not sold. I probably won't be sold for a while on the fold. But we'll see what can enter into the space there.

Dan, unlike Apple, Google can't seem to keep new devices under wraps, though. And so with this foldable Pixel device, you know, how does this all play into their broader kind of tech strategy or at least consumer technology strategy?

DANIEL HOWLEY: Yeah. It's interesting because for a long time, there was the conversation of whether or not the Pixel line would continue to go on because it's a loss-leader for them. They basically use it as a means to get Android out there. It's the most popular mobile operating system in the world. A lot of people in the US use iOS, sure, but you know, iPhones are expensive. And so in other parts of the world, they use Android devices. And that's, really, where Google is interested in pushing.

So it's something that they use to, basically, serve as a platform for other companies to say, look, this is what an Android phone is capable of doing when done as we see fit, or as we want it to be done. And so they focus on a lot of different technologies inside the device, whether that's reducing motion blur, night photography-- that's some of the best out there-- special capabilities for when you receive a phone call.

So they do have all of this AI smarts, or these AI smarts, in their phones that you really won't find on other devices. But the hardware themselves, you know, it's something that margins aren't gonna be as good as the advertising services. And so it's never gonna be kind of the main bread and butter for Google and Alphabet. It'll continue to be the search side. But it is something that they, seemingly, want to continue to move forward with for a while.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Well, we're looking forward to hearing about the specific announcements from there. Thanks a lot, Dan, for the preview. Appreciate it."

Smartphones have revolutionized the way we live our lives. Thanks to these gadgets, we can access a wealth of information, entertainment, and communication at our fingertips. But beyond their utility and convenience, the smartphone sector has also become one of the world's most valuable and lucrative industries. From Apple and Samsung to Huawei and Xiaomi, the companies that manufacture these devices have risen to the top of the global market, competing fiercely for market share and driving innovation at a breakneck pace.

Before we dive deep into the details of individual performances fueling the fierce smartphone market competition, it helps to explore the industry at large. Smartphone companies overall shipped 1.21 billion units in 2022, according to market research firm IDC. This, the firm said, represents the lowest global total annual shipment in nine years. The decline is largely due to global economic uncertainties and inflation, all of which dampened consumer demand.

Despite the decline, the shipment total is miles ahead of the figure when smartphones were just making their way to global markets. For example, only 173 million devices were shipped in 2009. The market then witnessed wild growth in sales, peaking at 1.47 billion units in 2016. This growth was primarily fueled by an exponential increase in smartphone adoption worldwide.

The number of smartphone users has consistently increased annually, although the net increase is thinning. For example, there were over 500 million new smartphone users every year between 2017 and 2020, bankmycell data shows. However, this number has now reduced to less than 350 million between 2020 and 2023.

However, it is worth noting that worldwide smartphone sales are not declining because of challenges related to the technology. On the contrary, we have already seen that smartphone adoption is rising, meaning that unit sales will continue to grow. An IMARC Group analysis determined that the global smartphone market will reach 1.77 billion units by 2028, which shows a 3.6% CAGR between 2023 and 2028.

Back to the smartphone companies. This article will take a closer look at the world's 20 most valuable smartphone companies. For years, Apple, Inc. and Samsung Electronics Ltd. have vied for the first place, leaving competitors in the dust. For example, the latest statistics from StatCounter show that Samsung claims 27.97% of the global smartphone market against 28.64% for Apple. Most Valuable Smartphone Companies in the World

348,2023-05-25T15:03:40+00:00,Stock market today: Dow slips to close lower ahead of key inflation report,"Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Monday, amid range-bound trading as investors looked to further catalysts including the consumer inflation report due later this week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.17%, or 55 points lower, the Nasdaq gained 0.2%, and the S&P 500 was flat.

Investors started the week preferring to keep their powder dry ahead of Aprilâs consumer price index, due Wednesday, that is expected to show an uptick in inflation for the month.

The inflation report comes just days after data on Friday flagged a tight labor market as the economy created more jobs than expected in April and unemployment unexpectedly fell, forcing investors to rein in their bets on rate cuts this year.

Regional banks continued to dominate attention as PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) gave up the bulk of gains despite opening up more than 30% higher after announcing that it had cut its dividend 1 cent from 25 cents a share in the previous quarter to boost its finances.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), however, helped boost financials after rising about 1% following quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

Consumer staples were also a drag on the broader market, paced by a 16% slump in Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) as the food production company slashed its revenue outlook after reporting an unexpected loss in the first quarter.

Big tech was mostly higher, with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leading to the upside amid media reports the search engine giant plans to make search more personal by incorporating AI chat and video.

Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) raised its full-year guidance, sending its shares more than 20% higher after pre-announcing better-than-expected quarterly results, as new contract wins bolster revenue.

âWe continue to believe ZS is a top name in this space to own as this cloud cybersecurity shift accelerates over the next decade as this was an impressive pre-announcement of earnings in this murky economic environment,â Wedbush said in a note.

Story continues

On the political front, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned of âdire consequencesâ should the U.S. fail to raise the debt ceiling. Yellen has previously warned the U.S. could default as early as June 1 should Congress fail to lift the limit on what the federal government can borrow.

The warning comes ahead of President Bidenâs meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other top congressional leaders this week to find a solution to the debt ceiling standoff.

But the former diplomat who served under two presidents and played a key role in defining American foreign policy during the Cold War has become a frequent opiner on A.I.âs latest developments, and Kissingerâs campaign to acknowledge the technologyâs dangers might be one of the final puzzle pieces to his legacy.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Talk over A.I. has hit a fever pitch in recent months, since the debut of OpenAIâs ChatGPT in November pushed Microsoft, Google, and other tech companies to kick off an A.I. arms race. People and businesses are now using A.I. in record numbers, while companies could be inching closer to cracking the code on human-like artificial intelligence.

But Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and National Security Advisor who will become a centenarian on May 27, was preoccupied with A.I. years before intelligent chatbots entered the cultural zeitgeist. He is now calling for governments to account for the technologyâs hazards, similarly to how he spent years championing for the end of nuclear weapon proliferation.

âThe speed with which artificial intelligence acts will make it problematical in crisis situations,â Kissinger said in an interview with CBS aired Sunday. âI am now trying to do what I did with respect to nuclear weapons, to call attention to the importance of the impact of this evolution.â

A.I.âs existential risks

Kissingerâs interest in the ramifications of A.I. date back to 2016, when he attended that yearâs Bilderberg Conference, a forum held since the 1950s for the alignment of U.S. and European interests.

Story continues

He attended the conference by invitation from Googleâs then-Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, according to a 2021 Timearticle. The two co-wrote a book, along with computer scientist Daniel Huttenlocher, in 2021 titled The Age of A.I., which argued that A.I. was on the precipice of sparking widespread revolutions in human society, while questioning whether we were ready for it.

That moment may have already arrived, and it is still unclear whether society is prepared. Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google employee who is often referred to as a âGodfather of A.I.,â has recently issued a series of warnings about A.I.âs dangers after leaving Google in part to talk openly about the subject.

Current A.I. capabilities are âquite scary,â Hinton told the BBC last week, and as machines become increasingly adept at a larger number of tasks, the opportunities for âbad actorsâ to use them for âbad thingsâ also grow, he told the New York Times earlier this month. In another interview with Reuters last week, Hinton warned that the existential risk of A.I. could even âend up being more urgentâ than climate change.

Over 1,000 technologists, historians, and computer scientists called for a moratorium on development of advanced A.I. systems in an open letter in March to gain a better understanding of the technologyâs capabilities and risks, especially as companies work on A.I. that could potentially match or surpass human intelligence. Other experts, including Hinton, have argued that it may be an impossible problem to solve, as the U.S. and China are already competing internationally on the A.I. front.

Kissinger, Schmidt, and Huttenlocher warned that A.I.âs capacities can âexpand exponentially as the technology advancesâ in a February op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. A.I.âs growing complexity with each new iteration means even its creators are not fully aware of what it can do, the co-authors cautioned. âAs a result, our future now holds an entirely novel element of mystery, risk and surprise,â they wrote.

Calls to regulate

The situation with A.I. has been compared to the crisis of unknown risks that surrounded the development of nuclear weapons during the second half of the 20th century that required international coordination to rein in. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said during the companyâs shareholder meeting last week that A.I., while âamazing,â could be compared to the development of the atomic bomb due to its potential dangers and because âwe wonât be able to un-invent it.â

Hinton also compared the existential threat of A.I. to that posed by nuclear weapons in an interview with CNN last week, as a possible area where the U.S. and China could cooperate on A.I. regulation.

âIf thereâs a nuclear war we all lose, and itâs the same if these things take over,â he said, although he did note in his New York Times interview that the situation with A.I. is completely different, as it is much easier for companies and countries to develop the technology behind closed doors than to create nuclear weapons.

Michael Osborne, a machine learning researcher at Oxford University, called for a non-proliferation agreement similar to that governing nuclear weapons to rein in A.I. during an interview with the Daily Telegraph in January. âââIf we were able to gain an understanding that advanced AI is as comparable a danger as nuclear weapons, then perhaps we could arrive at similar frameworks for governing it,â he said.

But in his interview with CBS, Kissinger acknowledged that an A.I. arms race represented a completely different ballgame from the race to develop nuclear weapons, given the vast unknowns.

â[I]t's going to be different. Because in the previous arms races, you could develop plausible theories about how you might prevail. It's a totally new problem intellectually,â he said.

353,2023-05-23T04:01:00+00:00,Hear this: Google using AI to build personalized hearing aids,"A joint venture between Google and various organizations in healthcare service delivery and research technology is using the power of AI to develop personalized hearing aids.

First announced earlier this year, the project sees the tech giant working with Cochlear, the manufacturer of cochlear implants, Macquarie University Hearing Hub members (NAL), the Shepherd Centre, and NextSense. Cochlear implant made by Advanced Bionics UK Ltd.

Google has said it aims to develop hearing aids that rely on AI to address individual listening needs. Such technology, Google said, will be particularly beneficial for those who rely on hearing aids in noisy environments such as restaurants, live performances, or public transportation.

By using AI, developers will be able to better identify and segregate sound sources, such as a person talking, making it easier for those who use hearing aids to follow a conversation.

SMART FITNESS STUDIO IN VIRGINIA USES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO CURATE WORKOUTS

The new technology will make a profound impact on those who rely on these devices. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are more than 1.5 billion people now living with hearing loss â and that number could rise to more than 2.5 billion by 2050.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.

Socially responsible investing is quickly becoming a norm rather than an exception as more and more people understand the importance of taking into account social conscience when making investment decisions. Socially responsible investing includes investing in companies that adhere to ethical or socially conscious business practices or steer clear of businesses or actions that harm the society according to many, including tobacco, alcohol, gambling, weapons, carbon emissions, child labor, etc. Socially responsible investing, ESG investing and impact investing have all seen a huge rise in popularity over the past few years.

According to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence, assets in the ESG space were expected to reach $41 trillion by the end of 2022. Historically, Europe has been at the forefront of ESG policy making and ESG investing but the Bloomberg report said that the US is now leading the investments in the ESG space.

The Rise of Socially Responsible ETFs

One of the most important trends seen in the socially responsible investing or ESG investing circles is the rise of ETFs and mutual funds. These give individual investors an easy and cost-effective way to have exposure to socially responsible companies. As an individual investors itâs difficult to find which companies are sticking to socially responsible business practices and ESG goals. So why not leave this legwork to the experts and just put your money into an ETF or mutual fund that is focused on finding such companies? The Bloomberg report cited data from Morningstar, which says that money held in ESG ETFs and sustainable mutual funds worldwide jumped 53% in 2021 to reach $2.7 trillion.

As investors grow socially conscious, hedge funds are also upping their activism in the space and many companies are facing heat from ESG-focused hedge funds that are forcing companies to get their act together and stick to environment-friendly business practices. For example, environment-focused fund Engine No. 1 in 2021 managed to defeat oil giant ExxonMobil and installed its two members on the companyâs board. The fund, which was not popular until this victory, received support from some of the biggest institutional investors of ExxonMobil, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. This shows the massive change ESG investing is ushering in at the Wall Street and how many investment firms and companies either willingly or unwillingly have to give in to this pressure.

Story continues

Engine No.1 in a scathing letter to ExxonMobilâs board of directors criticized the companyâs lack of adherence to its goals and targets related to climate. Hereâs what the historic letter said:

In an apparent acknowledgment of investor sentiment, ExxonMobil has now gone from dismissing emissions reduction goals as a âbeauty competitionâ to claiming repeatedly this month that its emissions reduction plans are âconsistentâ with the Paris Agreement.1 We have therefore reviewed the Companyâs claims with a number of experts, including Professor David Victor at the University of California San Diego, who was a convening lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which provides the analysis that underpins the Paris Agreement. After doing so, we believe it is clear that, as detailed below, the Companyâs true trajectory is nowhere near Paris consistency, and that a clear understanding of ExxonMobilâs claims underscores the long-term risk facing the Company in a decarbonizing world. None of the Companyâs new claims change its long-term trajectory, which would grow total emissions for decades to come. This is not consistent with, but rather runs directly counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement. We also continue to believe that without new members of the Board with the necessary expertise and experience, ExxonMobil will have little choice but to continue seeking to create the appearance of transformative long-term change, rather than working to make it a reality.

Backlash

But not all is good and rosy for the ESG investing world. ESG investors and climate activist funds are facing a backlash from some circles and ESG funds also saw a huge exodus of investors amid losses and tough macro backdrop.

For example, the iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF assets have dropped to $13.8 billion from $25 billion recorded a year ago, according to a Bloomberg report. The report said that as of March 2023, global assets of ESG ETFs were about $471 billion, as compared to $486 billion recorded in January. The report said that investors pulled a whopping $4.4 billion in a single week in March.

The report also said the industry was facing a âconcentrationâ problem, in which a handful of major funds were invested in the ESG space and when a single major fund decides to pull money from a fund, the overall industry sees a decline.

Some investors are also getting frustrated with what they believe an overemphasis on environment in the ESG spectrum. Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, who is the cofounder ofÂ  Just Capital, believes worker treatment should be the center of the ESG equation and not the environment.

According to CNBC, Jones said:

âSo much of ESG is politicized because the environmental part of the bucket seems to drive, or they would like to believe that the environmental part of it drives it, when in actuality the most important thing by a wide margin is how we pay and treat our workforce.â Best Socially Responsible Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Tesla is one of the most popular stocks among hedge funds and Wall Street analysts. Aristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.

Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Teslaâs sales.

We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The companyâs technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitorsâ offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.â

The global advertising market is one of the ever-evolving industries where innovation never stops. From billboards to newspapers and TV ads to web banners and video ads, the global advertising industry keeps changing based on the consumer behavior. What remains constant in the industry is the growth and expansion. While the global macro-economic backdrop and rising inflation forced advertisers to slow ad spend, ultimately affecting the overall industry last year and this year, the industry as a whole is growing.

According to Magna, a global media investment and intelligence firm, the ads market in 2023 is expected to grow 3.4%. This growth prediction was down from the 3.7% growth forecast Magna made in December. Still, the firm believes the growth remains upbeat in the industry, driven by new form of ads like short-form video ads mostly popular on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

Online ads giants Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been facing slowing growth in ads revenue since last year when ad spend budgets saw huge cuts as companies were spooked by the deteriorating global economic situation. However, Meta Platforms surprised the industry when it posted growth in its advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2023 in April. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ad revenue jumped 4.1% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the year-earlier period.

The Role of AI in Advertisements

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)âs CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the companyâs latest quarterly earnings call said AI played a key role in this growth. AI improved the companyâs algorithm behind content recommendation which increased average time spent by users on its platforms, ultimately increasing ads revenue.

Hereâs what Zuckerberg said:

âOur AI work comes in two main areas: first, the massive recommendations and ranking infrastructure that powers all of our main products -- from feeds to Reels to our ads system to our integrity systems and that weâve been working on for many, many years -- and, second, the new generative foundation models that are enabling entirely new classes of products and experiences. Our investment in recommendations and ranking systems has driven a lot of the results that we're seeing today across our discovery engine, Reels, and ads. Along with surfacing content from friends and family, now more than 20% of content in your Facebook and Instagram feeds are recommended by AI from people, groups, or accounts that you don't follow. Across all of Instagram, that's about 40% of the content that you see. Since we launched Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Our AI work is also improving monetization. Reels monetization efficiency is up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook quarter-over-quarter. Daily revenue from Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns is up 7x in the last six months.â

364,2023-05-21T23:01:58+00:00,Alphabet-backed Anthropic outlines the moral values behind its AI bot,"By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Anthropic, an artificial intelligence startup backed by Google owner Alphabet Inc, on Tuesday disclosed the set of written moral values that it used to train and make safe Claude, its rival to the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT.

The moral values guidelines, which Anthropic calls Claude's constitution, draw from several sources, including the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and even Apple Inc's data privacy rules.

Safety considerations have come to the fore as U.S. officials study whether and how to regulate AI, with President Joe Biden saying companies have an obligation to ensure their systems are safe before making them public.

Anthropic was founded by former executives from Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI to focus on creating safe AI systems that will not, for example, tell users how to build a weapon or use racially biased language.

Co-founder Dario Amodei was one of several AI executives who met with Biden last week to discuss potential dangers of AI.

Most AI chatbot systems rely on getting feedback from real humans during their training to decide what responses might be harmful or offensive.

But those systems have a hard time anticipating everything people might ask, so they tend to avoid some potentially contentious topics like politics and race altogether, making them less useful.

Anthropic takes a different approach, giving its Open AI competitor Claude a set of written moral values to read and learn from as it makes decisions on how to respond to questions.

Those values include ""choose the response that most discourages and opposes torture, slavery, cruelty, and inhuman or degrading treatment,"" Anthropic said in a blog post on Tuesday.

Claude has also been told to choose the response least likely to be viewed as offensive to any non-western cultural tradition.

In an interview, Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said a system's constitution could be modified to perform a balancing act between providing useful answers while also being reliably inoffensive.

""In a few months, I predict that politicians will be quite focused on what the values are of different AI systems, and approaches like constitutional AI will help with that discussion because we can just write down the values,"" Clark said.

365,2023-05-21T17:32:00+00:00,Microsoft Is Determined To Win The AI Wars As It Threatens Google's Online Search Dominance,"On April 25th, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) topped both top and bottom-line expectations with its fiscal third quarter results, showing no concerns like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) over cloud growth slowdown and giving Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) or more precisely, Google, a reason to fear for its leadership in the online search field.

Layoffs

Joining its parent Microsoft, as well as Amazon and Alphabet, social media network for professionals LinkedIn revealed today it will be cutting 716 jobs out of its 20,000 workforce as well as pulling the plug on its China-targeted job application due to lack of demand.

Fiscal Third Quarter Highlights

For the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft generatedÂ $52.86 billion in revenue that increased 7% YoY, topping Refnitivâs consensus estimate of $51.02 billion. Net income increased 9% YoY to $18.3 billion, or $2.45 per share, topping Refinitivâs earnings estimate of $2.23 per share.

Segments

Microsoftâs Intelligent Cloud business remains its most prolific segment that rose 16% and generated $22.08 billion in revenue, topping the StreetAccount consensus estimate of $21.94 billion.Â Growth from Azure and other cloud services slowed to 27% from 31% in the prior quarter, joining Amazon who also reported a cloud growth slowdown in April. Microsoftâs cloud performance was better than expectations ofÂ analysts CNBC pooled who expected on average 26.5% growth, while those gathered by StreetAccount were expecting 27.2%.Â But even Amazon warned that cloud will slow down further as troubled customers lower their spending in worsening macroeconomic conditions.

The Productivity and Business Process segmentÂ that housesÂ LinkedIn and OfficeÂ generated revenue ofÂ $17.52 billionÂ as it rose approximatelyÂ 11% and above the StreetAccount consensus of $17.05 billion.Â Moreover,Â growth in revenue per userÂ fueled a rise ofÂ 14%Â inÂ revenue from commercial Office 365 subscriptions.

Story continues

The Teams communication app expanded its userbase from its previously reported quarter as it went from 280 million toÂ 300 million monthly active users.

The More Personal Computing segment, featuring Bing, Windows, Surface and XboxÂ experienced a revenue drop of 9% as sales amounted toÂ $13.26 billion, but still toppedÂ $12.25 billionÂ consensus expectation fromÂ StreetAccount.Â OverÂ 100 million daily usersÂ are active on Bing whileÂ Â gaming subscriptions resulted in revenue of almost $1 billion.

In line with the PC market slump, sales of Windows operating-system licenses to computer makers dropped about 28%.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter Guidance

CFOÂ Amy Hood guided for revenue in the range between $54.85 billion to $55.85 billion in revenue,Â with the mid of the range translating to 6.7% growth but certainly exceeding Refinitivâs consensus estimate of $54.84 billion. Hood did not hide excitement about the early feedback from AI developments and positive demand signals the tech giant received.

ChatGPT Integration With Bing And Edge Marked The Beginning Of AI Wars For The Search Engine Throne

By applying its technology to its search engine and web browser, Microsoft officially opened the AI race as it firmly believes it has a good lead and a differentiated offering. CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the tech giant is looking for ways to reshape the largest software category on the planet, which puts Microsoft face to face to Google owned by Alphabet Inc. If Microsoft plays its cards well, Wedbush tech analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris believe the new AI integrations could results in major shifts from Google to Bing, which currently holds only 9% of the search market.

During the latest reported quarter, Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI under which it will draw on the companyâs artificial intelligence models to create a new version of its Bing search engine and enhance its Microsoft 365 productivity software. Interestingly,Â Sensor Tower data cited by Bank of America revealed that traffic for Bing spiked 16% in the six weeks upon Microsoftâs announcement ChatGPT will be incorporated into search, signaling a power shift dynamic on the online search field.

Googleâs Annual Conference

On Wednesday, Alphabet will be unveilingÂ its new general-use large language model called PaLM 2, as well as advancements to Bard and Search with âgenerative experiences. Undoubtedly, AI will be the central theme of this yearâs conference as Alphabet and Google promise to show how will AI help people reach their full potential. More importantly, Alphabet and Google need to show that they are not living on âborrowed timeâ in the upcoming AI era that promises to redefine the search field that Google has been dominating for two decades.

366,2023-05-21T12:00:00+00:00,"PayPal, IBM turn to A.I. to cut costs","In an earnings season where every company seems to need an artificial intelligence strategy, PayPal (PYPL) and IBM (IBM) are the latest to use the new technology to appeal to investors.

The evolving A.I. landscape, PayPal argues, will help the company operate more efficiently moving forward.

âWe expect A.I. will enable us to meaningfully lower our costs for years to come,â PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the companyâs earnings call. âFurthermore, we believe that A.I., combined with our unique scale and sets of data, will drive not only efficiencies, but will also drive a differentiated and unique set of value propositions for our merchants and consumers.â

While PayPal didn't explicitly say the cost-cutting impacts of A.I. mean fewer human workers, the announcement comes comes a week after IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg A.I. could replace nearly 8,000 of the companyâs jobs. Krishna added that the technology could complete simple tasks like shifting employees between departments.

Still, the A.I. call-outs haven't necessarily meant positive stock returns. IBM shares are down since the Bloomberg story published, and PayPal stock fell more than 10% amid concerns over its outlook for margin growth.

Mentions of âA.I.â are up 64% year-over-year in earnings calls, per Bank of America research, but the use cases often vary.

There are companies, like Alphabet's Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), who plan to use A.I. as a product to sell to other businesses. Others are powering A.I. with services and hardware like Nvidia (NVDA), which has seen its stock rise nearly 100% amid the A.I. boom. A PayPal sign is seen at an office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach (UNITED STATES - Tags: BUSINESS LOGO)

PayPalâs A.I. pitch hits at the core of the current moment in the tech industry, though, with layoffs mounting and one of the sectorâs largest players, Meta Platforms(META), touting a ""Year of Efficiency.â

When asked on Mondayâs earnings call how costs and operating expenses could be reduced beyond 2023, Schulman referred back to A.I.

Story continues

âYou're going to see our costs continue to come down year-over-year-over-year,â Schulman said. âAnd this is not just about efficiencies, by the way. It's not about just cost reduction. This is about doing things better. I think there's no question that A.I. is going to impact almost every function inside of PayPal, whether it be our front office, back office, marketing, legal, engineering, you name it.

""A.I. will have an impact and allow us to not just lower costs, but have higher performance and do things better.â

367,2023-05-21T09:52:00+00:00,"Facebook is wrong to say news lacks economic value, says Canada PM Trudeau","By Ismail Shakil

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said Meta Platforms Inc's opposition to proposed legislation that would compel payment by its Facebook unit and other internet companies for journalistic content was based on a flawed argument that news has no economic value.

Speaking to a parliamentary committee about the Trudeau government's legislation on Monday, a Meta official said news has a social value, but not an economic value to the company.

""If we are being asked to compensate these publishers for material that has no economic value to us, that's where the problem is,"" Meta's head of public policy in Canada, Rachel Curran, told the committee.

Trudeau on Tuesday said, ""that argument that the internet giants are putting forward is not just flawed, it's dangerous to our democracy, to our economy.""

Facebook's stance against paying news content ""shows how deeply irresponsible and out of touch they are,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.

The legislation, bill C-18 or the ""Online News Act"", proposes rules to force platforms like Facebook and Alphabet's Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content, a move similar to a ground-breaking law passed in Australia in 2021.

Both Google and Meta have warned they would withdraw access to news articles on their platforms in Canada if the bill is passed into law without amendments. Their main objection is paying for links to news articles posted on their websites that they say would be unsustainable for their businesses.

Facebook says links to news articles make up less than 3% of the content on its users' feed, and that journalists benefit from posting their work on the social media platform.

""Someone reporting on the horrors in Bucha (in Ukraine) is not trying to get likes on their Facebook page,"" Trudeau said.

Find Out: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch

With a share of the global search engine market that comes out to about 86%, according to Statista, the fact that Google is an important part of the daily lives of most people canât be understated.

GOBankingRates Googled some figures on Alphabet, Googleâs parent company, to see what this importance means for investors. Read on to learn about the companyâs net worth and other factors you should consider before investing.

About Google Headquarters Mountain View, California Year Founded 1998 Founders Sergey Brin, Larry Page CEO Sundar Pichai

Googleâs Worth Alphabet (GOOG) Share Price, 52-Week Range $83.45 â $123.26 Third-Quarter 2022 Revenue $69.8 billion Shareholdersâ Equity $260.89 billion

What Is Googleâs Net Worth?

Googleâs net worth can be calculated by subtracting the companyâs liabilities from its assets. Shareholdersâ equity, which likewise equals total assets minus total liabilities, is essentially a companyâs net worth. Alphabetâs total shareholdersâ equity as of the quarter ending Mar. 31 was $260.89 billionâthe highest itâs been in the past five years.

Take Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?

How Much Is Google Worth Now?

In early 2020, Alphabet became the third American tech company to reach a $1 trillion valuation, joining Apple and Microsoft â Tesla and Amazon since have joined the club.

The price of GOOG, Alphabetâs Class C shares, is up, at $108.24 as of May 8, 2023, giving Googleâs parent company a market capitalization of $1.37 trillion as of the same date. In addition to its Class C shares, there are also shares of GOOGL, Alphabetâs Class A common stock. Both types of shares are currently trading at relatively similar prices.

What Is Market Capitalization?

Market capitalization is one of several metrics that investors use to gauge how much a company is worth. The market cap is the value of all of the companyâs stock combined, giving you a sense of what value investors are placing on the company based on the price it is trading at. The figure can change as much as the share price does since itâs calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current trading price.

Although Alphabet shares have gone as high as $123.26 in the past year, the company is susceptible to market volatility, perhaps as a result of competing with tech giants like Apple and Amazon. Alphabetâs share price was $83.45 at its 52-week low. Swings in share price have, in turn, caused its market cap to vary widely over the same period. As of May 8, Google has a share price of $108.24 and a market capitalization of $1.37 trillion.

Alphabetâs Top 10 Shareholders

GOOGL has a high level of institutional ownership at 61.45%. The top 10 shareholders of Alphabetâs Class A stock are:

Shareholder Percentage of Shares The Vanguard Group Inc. 7.68% BlackRock Inc. 4.47% S SgA Funds Management, Inc. 3.64% Fidelity Management & Research Co. 3.37% Geode Capital Management LLC 1.97% T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. 1.91% Norges Bank Investment Management 1.59% Wellington Management Co. LLP 1.20% Massachusetts Financial Services 1.03% Northern Trust Investments Inc. 1.02%

Googleâs Founders

Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The two met at Stanford in 1995 and collaborated on a search engine called Backrub. Google is a play on the word âgoogol,â which is a one followed by 100 zeros. The name was a great summary of Googleâs mission âto organize the worldâs information and make it universally accessible and useful.â

Page has a net worth of $98 billion and Brin has a net worth of $93 billion as of May 8.

Key Product Lines Contributing to Revenue

Alphabet announced its first-quarter 2023 earnings on Apr. 25. The company generated revenues of about $69.8 billion, up 6% year over year despite declining ad revenues. Alphabet reported diluted earnings per share of $1.17, down from $1.23 a year ago.

Alphabetâs first-quarter 2023 earnings report highlighted a few areas that contributed to its success. One is the number of layoffs the company did, which led to a $2.6 billion reduction in charges related to workforce and office space.

Another aspect that boosted Alphabetâs earnings was a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated life of their servers and network equipment.

Lastly, the earnings report credited a shift in the timing of their annual employee stock-based compensation awards.

Is Google Worth the Money?

Experts say the stock is expected to go up 16% in the next three months, with a 90% probability it will hold a price between $117.96 and $131.36 at the end of that period. Analysts have positive expectations for the stock and do suggest it as a candidate to buy.

Everything we expect from Google's I/O developer conference

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) will host its annual I/O developers conference at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA, on Wednesday. And you can bet CEO Sundar Pichai will have plenty to say about Big Techâs latest obsession: generative AI.

Google is an AI juggernaut for sure. But the companyâs recent stumbles, namely its botched unveiling of its Bard chatbot and slow rollout of generative AI capabilities across its various products, have the tech giant playing catchup to arch rival Microsoft (MSFT) and its own Bing chatbot.

And the push to change that should kick off in earnest at I/O.

âWhat I would anticipate from Google I/O is a very strong generative AI-forward message where Google re-seizes the mantle for AI leadershipâ¦and you will likely see announcements specifically focused on that,â Gartner Analyst Chirag Dekate told Yahoo Finance.

Going all out on generative AI

Google has already made its own generative AI product announcements to combat Microsoftâs Bing. Bard, Googleâs chatbot, is available to select trusted users, and the company is rolling out waitlist invites to people who want to get access to generative AI features in its Google Workspace productivity suite.

You should expect to hear plenty of other announcements tied to both of those products.

âI would not be surprised if Google announced that it's expanding those features to Google Sheets or to Google Slides, or to make them more generally available to the masses not trusted trusted testers,â Forrester Analyst Nikhil Lai told Yahoo Finance. Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks on stage during the annual Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/ Stephen Lam

âGoogle, I think, bungled its launch of Bard. The stock tumbled when they fumbled that launch and the inaccuracy of Bard has been problematic,â Lai said. âWhen when users sign into Bard it talks about the limitations...so I think we'll see some enhancements there.â

Story continues

Itâs not just about Bard and Workspace, though. Google will likely announce new generative AI features across its product lines including its all-important search engine.

According to The New York Times, Google is developing a new feature for its search engine that will allow users to interact with an AI bot. The initiative, codenamed Magi, would also include more visual responses and posts from social media sites.

Googleâs search business powers the companyâs massive advertising division, which generates the bulk of its $283 billion in revenue in 2022. Any changes to its search product are a risky endeavor, but with Microsoftâs Bing already bringing AI chatbots to search, Google has to respond.

âThe good news is I think the market is headed where Google has been traditionally quite strong,â Dekate explained. âGoogle has always been, ever since its inceptionâ¦an AI-centric company. The only problem is that Google has not spoken a lot about what they've been doing in generative AI for the longest time.â Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a news conference in Berlin, Germany February 27, 2019.

That should change at I/O, though, as the company looks to put its generative AI chops on full display.

Hardware galore

But Google isnât just expected to roll out AI apps and services. The company will also show off its Pixel Fold smartphone. We already got a look at the foldable handset thanks to a teaser Google posted of the phone last week.

Like Samsungâs Galaxy Z Fold 5, the Pixel Fold features a cover display and a foldable internal display that opens up into a larger tablet-style screen. There appears to be a three camera setup on the back of the phone, suggesting itâll sport telephoto, ultra-wide angle, and wide angle lenses. According to CNBC, the Pixel Fold will cost upwards of $1,700.

Google is also expected to debut a new entry-level smartphone called the Pixel 7A. According to CNET, the phone, which is a low-cost version of last yearâs Pixel 7, will get many of its stablemateâs features and cost $499.

Thereâs also reportedly a Pixel Tablet in the works. And you can likely expect to get a glimpse at Googleâs upcoming Android 14 and maybe even its next-generation smartphone, the Pixel 8.

370,2023-05-20T13:00:15+00:00,"EU draft rules propose tougher cybersecurity labelling rules for Amazon, Google, Microsoft","By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and other non-European Union cloud service providers looking to secure an EU cybersecurity label to handle sensitive data can only do so via a joint venture with an EU-based company, according to an EU draft document seen by Reuters.

U.S. tech giants and others involved in the joint venture can only have a minority stake, and employees that have access to EU data would have to undergo specific screening and have to be located in the 27-country bloc, the document said.

The document adds the cloud service must be operated and maintained from the EU, and all cloud service customer data stored and processed in the EU and that EU laws take precedence over non-EU laws regarding the cloud service provider.

The latest draft proposal from EU cybersecurity agency ENISA concerns an EU certification scheme (EUCS) that would vouch for the cybersecurity of cloud services and determine how governments and companies in the bloc select a vendor for their business.

While the new provisions underscore EU concerns of interference from non-EU states, they are likely to spark criticism from U.S. tech giants worried about being shut out from the European market.

Big Tech is looking to the government cloud market to drive growth in the coming years while a potential boom in AI after the viral success of OpenAI's ChatGPT could also boost demand for cloud services.

""Certified cloud services are operated only by companies based in the EU, with no entity from outside the EU having effective control over the CSP (cloud service provider), to mitigate the risk of non-EU interfering powers undermining EU regulations, norms and values,"" the document said.

""Undertakings whose registered head office or headquarters are not established in a ember State of the EU shall not, directly or indirectly, solely or jointly, hold positive or negative effective control of the CSP applying for the certification of a cloud service,"" it said.

Story continues

The document said the tougher rules will apply to personal and non-personal data of particular sensitivity where a breach may have a negative impact on public order, public safety, human life or health, or the protection of intellectual property.

The latest draft could fragment the EU single market as each country has full discretion to impose the requirements whenever it sees fit, an industry source said.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has previously said that the plan puts U.S. companies on an unequal footing. The EU says the moves are necessary to protect the bloc's data rights and privacy.

EU countries will review the draft later this month after which the European Commission will adopt a final scheme.

371,2023-05-20T12:50:00+00:00,A leaked Google memo raises questions about open source A.I. But the White House doesnât seem to have gotten it,"It was another big week of A.I. news. The White House summoned the heads of four technology companies working on cutting-edge A.I. to a meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss potential regulation. President Joe Biden dropped by the meeting to issue an on-camera warning to the assembled executives that âwhat youâre doing has enormous potential and enormous danger.â He also said he was sure the executives were aware of this and that he hoped they could âeducate us as to what you think is most needed to protect society.â

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

A summary of the meeting later provided by the White House said that the executives and Harris had âa frank and constructive discussionâ on the need for the companies to be more transparent about their A.I. systems, the importance of there being a way to evaluate and verify the safety, security, and performance of this software, and the need to secure the systems from malicious actors and attacks. The White House also used the occasion to announce several new initiatives, including $140 million in funding to establish seven new National A.I. Research Institutes, a major red-teaming exercise where seven major A.I. companies will voluntarily submit their A.I. models to probing by independent security, safety, and ethics researchers at the DEFCON 31 cybersecurity conference in August, and a policymaking effort from the Office of Management and Budget that will result in guidelines for how the U.S. federal government will use A.I. software.

What got the most attention, however, is who was in the roomâand who wasnât. Meeting with Harris were the CEOs of Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. (Google DeepMindâs Demis Hassibis also looked to be there from the video clip of Biden addressing the group.) When asked why only these companies, and not others, were present, the White House said it wanted to meet with the âfour American companies at the forefront of A.I. innovation.â Many read that as a burn on Mark Zuckerbergâs Meta, which has invested heavily in A.I. technology and research, but, unlike the companies meeting with Harris, has not integrated the technology into a consumer-facing do-it-all chatbot, as well as Amazon and Apple, both of which are perceived as lagging in A.I. development.

Story continues

But there were a lot of other players absent: Nvidia is participating in the red-teaming exercise at DEFCON 31 but wasnât invited to the White House. Yet itâs an American company, its chips are a linchpin of the current generative A.I. boom, and it is also building its own large language models. What about Cohere (which is technically Canadian) but is also building very large language models, with financial backing and close support from Google?

There also were no representatives from the fast-growing open-source A.I. ecosystem, most notably Hugging Face and Stability AI, both of which are also participating in the DEFCON 31 exercise. Stability is a British company, but Hugging Face is incorporated in the U.S., and its CEO and cofounder, Clem Delangue, although French, lives in Miami. The open-source models these companies are building (and hosting in the case of Hugging Face) are being used by thousands of businesses and individual developers. They are rapidly matching the capabilities of the systems built by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. These open-source players really ought to be âin the room where it happensâ if the Biden Administration is serious about grappling with A.I. and its risks.

Arguably, the dangers with open-source software are greater than with the private models the big tech companies are building and making available through APIs: While is often easier to find security vulnerabilities or safety flaws with open-source software, it is also much easier for those with ill-intentions, or simply a cavalier attitude towards potential risks, to use these models however they want. If you wanted to create a malware factory, it would make more sense to download an open-source language model like Alpaca from Hugging Face than rely on OpenAIâs API. OpenAI could always cut off your access if it discovered your operation. People are also already using open-source software to turn LLMs into nascent agents that can perform actions across the internet. Regulating the open-source A.I. world is a much, much bigger challenge than slapping limits on companies like Microsoft and Google. But any serious effort to govern advanced A.I. is going to have to figure out what to do about open-source.

Which brings me to another very interesting bit of A.I. news from last week: that allegedly leaked Google âWe have no moatâ memo. Google has neither confirmed nor denied the memoâs legitimacy, but it seems likely to be genuine. The reason it leaked when it did, the same day as the White House meeting, is indeed suspect. (Since it makes the case that Googleâs A.I. tech is increasingly being matched, if not superseded in some respects, by open-source alternatives and thus might bolster arguments that the âbig fourâ called to the White House should not be singled out for any regulatory action.)

The leaked memo does a good job of laying out some of the problems with the ultra-large generative A.I. models that Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have been building their products around: The open-source community has quickly sussed out clever and innovative ways to mimic their performance with smaller models trained at a fraction of the cost, both financial and in terms of energy and carbon footprint. These models often run much faster and allow users to keep any proprietary data private. All of which means these open-source A.I. Ford Focuses and Volkswagens may be preferred, especially by large enterprise customers, over big techâs A.I. Cadillacs and Rolls Royces. The open source community has also, as the memoâs anonymous author notes, not gotten hung up around sensitivities concerning âresponsible releaseââit just puts stuff out there as fast as possible.

But as Emad Mostaque, Stability cofounder and CEO, tweeted, the memoâs author doesnât seem to actually understand the concept of âmoatsâ as applied to business strategy. In business, moats are only rarely about a core technology. They are more often around a productâwhich includes UX as well as feature setsâdata, location, convenience, customer service, and brand. Mostaque reckons that OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google still have some big advantages in most of those areas that will be hard for others to match. One thing about serving proprietary models through APIs is that they are much easier for companies with less technical expertise to implement and maintain than open-source models are. The plugins that OpenAI has created for ChatGPT also make that product very sticky, as Mostaque points out.

One thing I think the leaked memo probably does capture accurately, at least in its tone, is the sense of pure panic within Google over the sudden challenge to its position at the forefront of A.I. technology. Tomorrow, Google will unveil a host of new A.I. product enhancements at its annual Google I/O developer conference that will constitute a big part of its effort to fight back. Weâll see how successful it is in being able to recalibrate perceptions about its place in the A.I. arms race.

372,2023-05-20T12:23:51+00:00,"Wendy's, Google preview partnership with new AI-powered drive-thru","Yahoo Finance culinary correspondent Brooke DiPalma joins the Live Show to discuss the partnership between Wendy's and Google to revolutionize drive-thru orders with the use of AI technology, first premiering in Columbus, Ohio in June of this year, and how AI is transforming the restaurant industry.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Wendy's is partnering with Google Cloud to bring AI to its drive throughs. Now, this is called Wendy's Fresh AI. The pilot kicks off in June in Columbus, Ohio area at a company operated restaurant. Brooke DiPalma is here with those details. Brooke, it sounds exciting.

BROOKE DIPALMA: Good afternoon. It certainly does sound exciting. Pretty interesting here. I'm eager to see how exactly it works, but as you noted this is one of the first partnerships that have come out of this collaboration between Google Cloud and Wendy's.

That partnership began in 2021. This is called Wendy's Fresh AI. The first pilot of Wendy's Fresh AI sets launch in June in Columbus, Ohio near its headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. Now, in addition to that, the company wants you to know that the AI technology has the ability to understand made to order requests, which they say includes billions of different combinations.

For example, if a customer asks for a large milkshake, this technology will know that they're asking for a frosty. In addition to that, they said that it'll be as natural as interacting with employees. Eager to see if customers think so as well. And in this pilot customers can expect a female voice. Now, what you also need to know is that Wendy's expects here to improve speed, accuracy, and consistency with this automated technology.

And based on this pilot, Wendy's is looking for a few key things in addition to that drive-through speed. The customer is also taking a closer look at order averages. They hope to see a boost in sales with upselling opportunities that the AI technology will offer like larger sizes, asking customers perhaps if they want a frosty with their orders, in addition to daily specials. And this comes as drive-through remains a key opportunity for Wendy's. About 75% to 80% of Wendy's customers prefer drive-thru now, Seana, that's a big jump compared to roughly 2/3 before the COVID 19 pandemic.

Story continues

And Wendy's hoping to be not only a game changer here, but a leader in AI technology and the drive-thru.

SEANA SMITH: It certainly makes sense. It certainly seems like that with the recent moves there. When it comes to AI, we talk about how so many companies are talking about it on their earnings releases. It sounds like Wendy's isn't the only food company and not the only fast food chain that's incorporating AI. Who are some of the others?

BROOKE DIPALMA: Right, certainly not alone in that. In fact, this is probably the top, if not the topic of this earnings season. I mean, we heard McDonald's mention it in their earnings call, but in addition to that, they also teamed up with IBM back in 2021 to further accelerate and to development and deployment of their automated voice ordering technology. We've heard some customer feedback about the accuracy of it. A bit of a rough start there.

Wingstop in March partnered with AI voice startup Converse. Now they're running a pilot where they're using voice AI powered virtual assistants to take customers' phone orders at select locations. We're also seeing Yum Brands using recommended ordering to understand how much food is needed at restaurants.

And Chipotle using AI for kitchen management to streamline operations. They also introduced Chippy the robot and what they call an AI kitchen assistant to make chips. Chipotle's CFO also weighed in on the opportunity saying that it is taking a well thought out approach. Take a listen.

JACK HARTUNG: There's a lot of possibilities. There's also a lot of pitfalls as well. So we want to be very careful, very thoughtful. But, certainly, if there's ways we can make the job that our crews do, the jobs that our support staff do to support a restaurant easier and better and if the end result is we can run better restaurants and serve the customers in a better way, we're certainly going to look at any technology.

BROOKE DIPALMA: And, of course, this earnings season is not over yet. There's more food companies set to report later on this week, including Wendy's before the bell on Wednesday. We also have Cheesecake Factory after the bell on Wednesday in addition to Krispy Kreme Thursday before the bell. And so certainly something to look out for, something that we've heard not only from food chains, but also PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, looking to get into the mix here. And so something for investors and also Main Street to look out for.

Perhaps, you'll be ordering your drive-thru a little bit different in the near future.

SEANA SMITH: All right, Brooke. Exciting stuff. Thanks so much."
373,2023-05-20T11:30:00+00:00,Tech earnings featured more stock buybacks â here's what that means for investors,"Share repurchases, or stock buybacks, have appeared over and over in tech companies' earnings this year. But they might be misunderstood, according to Cornell University assistant professor Nick Guest.

""Our main takeaway is that share buybacks don't create or destroy a lot of wealth,"" Guest told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""So you might wonder, 'Well, why are companies repurchasing on track for more than $1 trillion this year?' The benefits seem to be an opportunity for management to signal that they believe the stock is undervalued.""

There are plenty of criticisms of buybacks, including that companies use them to manipulate their share prices. But those criticisms haven't been necessarily proven by the data, according to Guest.

""Some argue they're associated with excessive executive compensation and that companies that buy back don't have as much cash available to take advantage of investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing growth and ultimately profitability,"" he said. ""But our evidence comparing both companies that repurchased and companies that don't repurchase shares didn't find any large-scale, on average, evidence of those things.""

Some of the biggest buyback news of this earnings cycle came from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). If Google's $70 billion buyback announcement seems big, it is â sort of, VerityData analyst Ali Ragih said.

""$70 billion is slightly large for them, but not when you compare and adjust market-wide,"" he said. ""The best way to think about $70 billion is to compare against the market cap because you can better normalize market-wide. $70 billion is equal to 5.2% of the market cap at Google.""

Likewise, Apple (AAPL) also announced it would buy back $90 billion in stock this week.

Why companies buy back stock â and when they should

So why do these companies do stock buybacks?

""Repurchases have more flexibility than dividends,"" Guest said. ""They're easier to temporarily cut during downtime, and repurchasing shares reduces the amount of cash that could be misused on management's pet projects.""

Story continues

Another reason, Guest added, is that ""managers and others â the board, for example â can use repurchased shares to compensate employees. So those seem to be the benefits, as opposed to improving long-term profitability or creating additional investment opportunities.""

It's worth doing buybacks when management thinks the company's valuation is low, Ragih said.

""The best time to do a buyback is when the valuation is low because companies get the most bang for their buyback,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""If Google spends $15 billion, theyâd want to get the most amount of shares for that $15 billion â lower stock price will get them more shares for the same overall dollar value of spend.""

It's even more worthwhile if the company in question has the cash, which Alphabet does, Ragih added. Google logo is seen on a balloon at Google office in a historical building at the Main Square in Krakow, Poland on November 29, 2022. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

""Google has a high amount of free cash flow and not much else to spend it on, so itâs appropriate to return cash to shareholders,"" he said. ""To boil it down, after they pay for organic investments, they still have a lot of cash left each quarter. The cash balance is about $100 billion so they defer to buybacks.""

However, buyback backlash has increased in recent years. Critics say that they enrich companies and executives without improving the overall economy. So over time, shareholders may see fewer buybacks if that trend continues.

""If the disincentives increase â for example, if we get this 4% tax or other limits on what managers can do in terms of selling their own shares after the company has bought back shares, and other potential restrictions â then some firms might decide to retain the cash instead or switch to dividends, which both could have negative consequences,"" Guest said. ""For example, dividends, as we know, are taxed as income tax, ... whereas repurchases typically generate a capital gain. So that could create some additional costs for shareholders.""

The companiesâ decisions to keep their research on AI more closely held comes as the two firms find themselves at the center of the race to field new AI applications â a race that could become more competitive with smaller upstarts that gain insights from publicly available AI research.

Google, long a leader in the AI field, had published several hundred studies on AI since 2019 through Google Research. But it found itself caught off guard by the surge of interest in OpenAIâs ChatGPT AI-informed chatbot when it was initially released last fall and showcased notable improvements when an updated, more powerful version of the generative AI bot was rolled out this March.

HEAR THIS: GOOGLE USING AI TO BUILD PERSONALIZED HEARING AIDS Google and AI rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, are in the midst of a fierce competition that has made them more reluctant to share their AI research publicly.

Due in part to concerns that the development of ChatGPT was aided by the information contained in AI-related academic papers published by Google Research, the company announced a policy change earlier this year on the release of AI studies.

Under the new policy, Google researchers will only release AI research papers after it has taken the opportunity to incorporate the findings of those papers into the companyâs products, according to a report by the Washington Post citing sources familiar with the meeting in which the move was announced.

The report also noted that Google also accelerated its AI product launch processes to turn those papers into viable products more quickly by putting in place new evaluation metrics.

WENDYâS ADDING GOOGLE CLOUD AI TECH TO DRIVE-THRU ORDERING AS PART OF TEST Google has reportedly changed an internal policy to curtail the public sharing of its AI research until the company has incorporated it into its products.

OpenAI, which has received financial backing from Microsoft as part of an exclusive partnership, has also published some of its AI research over the years. An archive on the companyâs site lists 161 published research papers dating back to 2016.

Story continues

In an interview with The Verge, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever said while the company shares information with academic and research institutions to help develop safeguards, it was ""wrong"" to have shared its research more broadly because it could lead eventually allow AI to develop to the point it becomes an artificial general intelligence (AGI) equivalent in intelligence to humans.

""If you believe, as we do, that at some point AI â AGI â is going to be extremely, unbelievably potent, then it just does not make sense to open-source,"" Sutskever told the outlet. ""It is a bad ideaâ¦ I fully expect that in a few years itâs going to be completely obvious to everyone that open-sourcing AI is just not wise.""

GOOGLE, MICROSOFT IN Q1 EARNINGS PROVIDE UPDATES ON AI PUSH OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever said the company was ""wrong"" to have publicly shared its AI research in the past.

While concerns about tipping off the competition may be a prominent deterrent to sharing research on AI, there are other reasons that can contribute to such a decision.

For example, legal liability could potentially arise from the use of copyrighted material within the parameters on which AI technology is trained â which typically involve massive quantities of information scraped from the internet.

377,2023-05-19T19:25:22+00:00,Google expected to unveil its answer to Microsoft's AI search challenge,"By Jeffrey Dastin

May 10 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Wednesday is expected to unveil more artificial intelligence in its products to answer the latest competition from Microsoft Corp, which has threatened its perch atop the nearly $300-billion search advertising market.

Through an internal project code-named Magi, Google has looked to infuse its namesake engine with generative artificial intelligence, technology that can answer questions with human-like prose and derive new content from past data.

The effort will be the most closely watched as Google executives take the stage at its yearly conference I/O in Mountain View, California, near its headquarters. The result could alter how consumers access the world's information and which company wins the global market for search advertising, estimated by research firm MAGNA to be $286 billion this year.

For years the top portal to the internet, Google has found its position in question since rivals began exploiting generative AI as an alternative way to present content from the web.

First came ChatGPT, the chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that industry observers called Google's disruptor. Next came Bing, Microsoft's search engine updated with a similarly dextrous chatbot, which can answer queries where no obvious result existed online -- like what car seat to buy for a particular model vehicle.

Microsoft last month touted U.S. share gains for Bing, recently growing to more than 100 million daily active users, still dwarfed by billions of searches on Google.

Google's rivals have taken its research breakthroughs from prior years and run with them, outpacing their inventor. That has represented a technological affront and a business one: Microsoft said every percentage point of share it gained in search advertising could draw another $2 billion in revenue.

For months now, teams at Google have sprinted to release technology at I/O or prior, like its ChatGPT competitor Bard, defending the company's turf.

Story continues

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, this year said generative AI to distill complex queries would come to Google Search, as would more perspectives, ""like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar.""

Google is also seeking to restate its research mantle. At Wednesday's conference, it is expected to announce a more powerful AI model known as PaLM 2, CNBC reported.

It is also expected to showcase new hardware for its lineup of Pixel devices, media have reported. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Sheila Dang; Editing by David Gregorio)"

Through an internal project code-named Magi, Google has looked to infuse its namesake engine with generative artificial intelligence, technology that can answer questions with human-like prose and derive new content from past data.

The effort will be the most closely watched as Google executives take the stage at its yearly conference I/O in Mountain View, California, near its headquarters. The result could alter how consumers access the world's information and which company wins the global market for search advertising, estimated by research firm MAGNA to be $286 billion this year.

For years the top portal to the internet, Google has found its position in question since rivals began exploiting generative AI as an alternative way to present content from the web.

First came ChatGPT, the chatbot from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that industry observers called Google's disruptor. Next came Bing, Microsoft's search engine updated with a similarly dextrous chatbot, which can answer queries where no obvious result existed online -- like what car seat to buy for a particular model vehicle.

Microsoft last month touted U.S. share gains for Bing, recently growing to more than 100 million daily active users, still dwarfed by billions of searches on Google.

Google's rivals have taken its research breakthroughs from prior years and run with them, outpacing their inventor. That has represented a technological affront and a business one: Microsoft said every percentage point of share it gained in search advertising could draw another $2 billion in revenue.

For months now, teams at Google have sprinted to release technology at I/O or prior, like its ChatGPT competitor Bard, defending the company's turf.

Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, this year said generative AI to distill complex queries would come to Google Search, as would more perspectives, ""like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar.""

Google is also seeking to restate its research mantle. At Wednesday's conference, it is expected to announce a more powerful AI model known as PaLM 2, CNBC reported.

It is also expected to showcase new hardware for its lineup of Pixel devices, media have reported.

381,2023-05-19T17:16:00+00:00,Exclusive: Google accused of breaking European privacy law by hoarding personal data of potential job candidates for years,"When Mohamed Maslouh, a London-based contractor, was assigned to enter data into Google's internal gHire recruitment system last September, he noticed something surprising. The database contained the profiles of thousands of people in the EU and U.K. whose names, phone numbers, personal email addresses and resumÃ©s dated back as far as 2011.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Maslouh knew something was amiss, as he had received data-protection training from Randstad, the European human-resources giant that employed him, and was aware of the EU's five-year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which remained part of British law after Brexit.

Under the law, companies in the European Union and U.K. may not hang onto anyoneâs personal dataâthat is, information relating to any identifiable living personâfor longer than is strictly necessary, which generally means a maximum retention time measured in weeks or months.

Google may now face investigations over potential violations of the GDPR, after Maslouh filed protected whistleblower complaints with the U.K. Information Commissionerâs Office in November and with the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC)âwhich has jurisdiction over Googleâs activities in the EUâin February.

The allegations come at a time when Google is already under scrutiny in both the EU and the U.K. over potentially anticompetitive behavior around online ad technology and billing practices in its Android app store, and as it continues to appeal a $4.3 billion fine levied by the EU over other Android-related antitrust abuses. The company has previously been fined tens of millions of euros over GDPR violations, by authorities in France, Spain and Sweden.

Story continues

Google says it deployed a global automatic deletion tool last year to âprotect the privacyâ of job applicants and candidates in gHire, in line with the GDPR's demands. The rollout ended in the fall, after Maslouh raised his concerns with Randstad and Google, but Google says it announced the tool internally as early as 2021.

However, even if the offending data has now been deleted as Google says, the timeline would indicate over four years of non-compliance after the GDPR came into effect in May 2018, bringing with it the threat of fines as high as 4% of global annual revenues for severe violations.

""If it takes them so long to be in line with the law then it's their problem, because they are breaching some people's privacy,"" German data-protection lawyer Michael Kissler told Fortune.

Google's deletion processes

Google told Fortune the deletion toolâs rollout followed several years of careful development, to ensure it met both regulatory demands and the company's business needs.

âGoogle would have been obligated to delete data within a maximum of one year [after the end of the application procedure] had they implemented appropriate measures,â said Nandenie Lachman, a Dutch privacy lawyer whose profile was among those Maslouh saw.

Although the GDPR itself doesnât specify the maximum retention time that is allowed, it says personal data must be âkept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessaryâ for the purpose behind its collection. The European Commission has stressed that data âmust be stored for the shortest time possible.â The Dutch privacy regulator says it is âcustomaryâ to delete such data no longer than four weeks after the application procedure ends, though the data can be kept for up to a year if applicants give their permission for extended retention (which Lachman says she did not do).

Under the GDPRâwhich treats any processing of personal data as illegal unless there's a good reason behind itâthe burden of proof is on Google to explain how what it was doing was legal, according to Kissler, who suggested Google might be on the hook over its collection of data as well as holding onto it for too long.

""If they cannot have a deletion process in place that is good enough, then why did they collect the data in the first place, if they knew it?"" Kissler asked. ""So they breached it and they then further breached it and said, 'It took so long because we're such a big company'. So what? That cannot be the argument.""

âWe have tight policies, processes, and access restrictions to protect the privacy of applicants and candidates, which are in line with laws, including the GDPR,â said a Google spokesperson. âLike most companies, we continuously update our internal processes and systems as laws change.â

âWe only retain specific information on job candidates for a limited amount of time, which is an industry practiceâand only for candidates who applied to a role at Google, who were referred for a role by a Googler, or who a recruiter believed might be a strong fit for a role based on their public job profile.â

What the whistleblower found

Maslouh was last year a 34-year old employee of Randstad, which was contracted by Google to identify potential job candidates and enter their publicly available informationâderived from services such as LinkedInâinto gHire, Googleâs applicant tracking system.

When he accessed the system with authorization, Maslouh noticed the excessive age of some of the European personal data within it, and also noted that many of the records for so-called passive applicantsâwho had not actively applied to Googleâshowed no evidence of Google ever having reached out to them. Many of these individuals were listed as working for organizations such as Interpol, the CIA, the U.K. Home Office, the European Parliament, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mohamed Maslouh (photo provided by subject).

Maslouh complained to Randstad about the legal consequences of a potential GDPR violation, and the ethical issues around collecting passive candidatesâ data at a time when Google had a hiring freeze in placeâit should be noted here that, when Google announced its hiring slowdown in July 2022, it said it would continue to hire for âengineering, technical and other critical roles.""

âWhen I myself apply for a job or use any services, I want those people to be compliant with the legislation,â Maslouh told Fortune.

Maslouh says Randstad advised him to write an anonymous whistleblower report about the GDPR issue to Google, through the Big Tech firmâs submission portal. He did so in mid-October, before filing his whistleblower reports with the U.K. ICO and the Irish DPC. The complaints, which Fortune has seen, noted that âa significant amount of this information has been retained on the system sinceÂ 2011 [and] has not been deleted,â while also claiming that Google obtained some of the personal data âthough âscrapingâ it from the Internetâ.

The term âscrapingâ refers to the automated extraction of online data, which is a risky practice under the GDPR for a few reasons: it can involve extracting more data than is necessary for the task at hand; the affected people donât know their data has been scraped; and peopleâs really sensitive dataâabout things like race or healthâcan only be legally collected with their explicit consent. Maslouh based his scraping accusation on the lack of recorded correspondence in some peopleâs gHire profiles, along with what he saw as a suspicious mismatch between the candidatesâ recorded employment and the roles for which they might be considered.

However, Googleâwhich points out that it recruits people from a wide range of backgroundsâstrongly denies scraping potential candidatesâ non-public data.

âOur system only hasÂ resumÃ© information from job applications we have received from candidates, through referrals or publicly available information relevant to our recruitment,â Googleâs spokesperson said. âAny informationÂ we have about candidates' current or previous employment was either provided to us directly by the candidate or was included in their resumÃ© or public profile.â

Fortune spoke with six of the people whose data was in evidence collected by Maslouh in early September last year. Only one said he had never applied for a job with Google nor been contacted by the companyâand Google disputes this. One refused to comment, and the other four all confirmed having had interactions with Google.

Maslouh no longer works for Randstad. When he refused to continue working on the Google account until he was satisfied that the work was GDPR-compliant, he says Randstad asked if he would prefer to work on another account, then failed to provide any such options and asked if he would prefer to leave the company. Maslouh says he took that option and, after filing a constructive dismissal case, received four monthsâ pay in compensation.

âRandstad encourages the reporting of any concerns via our misconduct reporting procedure which is available to all employees, talent, and third parties,â a Randstad spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company declined to respond to Maslouh's account of his departure, saying it is ""unable to comment on individual cases.""

According to Kissler, many companies fail to comply with Europe's privacy law because ""itâs a general problem that the GDPR is not enforced well enough by the authorities.""

""Companies take the risk very often just because they know its very unlikely that something happens [to them],"" he said.

The U.K. Information Commissionerâs Office declined to comment on Maslouhâs complaint, saying it cannot âprovide commentary on active complaints brought to us by an individual.â The Irish Data Protection Commission did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

383,2023-05-19T15:55:24+00:00,US Antitrust Enforcers Are Chilling Big Mergers,"(Bloomberg) -- The US governmentâs aggressive stance on antitrust is chilling merger activity among the countryâs biggest companies, with some deals never making it past the boardroom as executives fear lengthy and expensive approval processes.

US enforcers have roughly doubled their efforts to block mergers under the Biden administration: in the 12 months through September, the antitrust agencies filed complaints against a record 13 transactions compared to an average of six per year over the previous five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Though deals involving US companies have steadily increased, the recent pace of interventions by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission has stunted that growth: The agencies are also claiming credit for another 26 mergers that they say were abandoned in the face of antitrust investigations, some of which were pulled before they were even made public.

The approach has discouraged some companies from pursuing unions they wouldâve leapt at in the past, according to dozens of conversations with M&A advisers, corporate executives, former regulators and antitrust practitioners. Many of them described an environment thatâs generally hostile to dealmaking, even for transactions that they wouldnât have expected to raise antitrust concerns. While antitrust laws havenât changed, the stepped-up enforcement means dealmaking has gotten costlier, as well as more uncertain and time-consuming, they said.

Last year, for example, Alphabet Inc.âs Google put aside internal discussions about potentially acquiring another large technology company because of concerns it would attract too much antitrust scrutiny, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to identify the potential target. A representative for Alphabet didnât immediately respond to a request for comment.

Story continues

A different person, who pitched the head of a $50 billion company on a $20 billion takeover, said the executive immediately cut him off because he thought the deal would never fly. Several years ago, the person said, he wouldâve expected the same proposal to pique the CEOâs interest and lead to a discussion about how to get it done.

Though deal volumes have slipped significantly this year, plenty of M&A is still getting done. The vast majority of transactions donât rise to the level of significant regulatory oversight, and many executives are willing to weather the increased scrutiny if they really want a deal. Much of the slump in activity can be explained by a poor macroeconomic environment for dealmaking: CEO confidence is low in the face of a potential recession, interest rates are high and financing is tough to come by.

But after decades where the US favored a light-touch approach for almost all but the biggest deals, President Joe Bidenâs administration has altered that strategy, souring the environment. A sweeping executive order signed by Biden in 2021 encouraged government agencies to âenforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry,â an approach thatâs become a key tenet of his administrationâs economic policy.

Biden appointed prominent antitrust hawks to follow through on the pledge: Jonathan Kanter helms the Justice Departmentâs antitrust division while Lina Khan oversees the FTC. Both have argued publicly that previous administrations were too permissive, leading to a rise in corporate concentration thatâs limited choices for consumers and contributed to a spike in prices.

âWe have much more to do to reverse the decades of concentrated corporate power,â Biden said at an event on May 4.

Global Decisions

In some prominent cases, the international reach of large companies is pulling in regulators from all over the world and bolstering the US agenda.

Last month, the UKâs Competition and Markets Authority vetoed Microsoft Corp.âs $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc., further cementing its position alongside the US and EU at the center of global antitrust decisions. The FTC had already sued to block the deal, and hearings are scheduled to start in August in a bellwether case for Khanâs agency. The European Commission is due to rule on the transaction later this month.

One M&A lawyer wryly joked that his firmâs antitrust partners are billing more hours than their M&A counterparts as companies spend as long as six months assessing competition risks before even starting discussions or due diligence. Several M&A bankers complained about the hours they have to spend on lengthy phone calls with antitrust lawyers.

For every multibillion-dollar merger that doesnât happen, corporate Americaâs network of M&A bankers â whose job it is to pitch and advise on transactions â miss out on hundreds of millions of dollars. Investment-banking fees across the five biggest Wall Street banks plummeted 49% in 2022, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, while the industrywide bonus pool sank by 21%.

One of the main hurdles that worries advisers is the amount of time itâs taking regulators to review deals that would have previously been straightforward. Companies have to bake in more time for deals to close and get longer-term bridge financing, an expensive type of debt thatâs meant to be a stopgap. The longer a deal is in limbo, the bigger the risk that clients and employees move on.

In some cases, the length of antitrust reviews has meant that a mergerâs financing will fall through, said Amanda Wait, who heads the US antitrust practice at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.

One large drugmaker abandoned plans to acquire a smaller rival after estimating the deal would take 24 months to get the necessary approvals, a person familiar with the matter said. It would revisit the deal, which includes some overlap between each companyâs drugs, if thereâs a change in administration that brings friendlier regulators, the person said. Meanwhile, the FTC has already been investigating Tempur Sealy International Inc.âs proposed deal with Mattress Firm Inc., announced on May 9, since last year, Bloomberg News reported.

Sellers are also pushing for higher reverse breakup fees to protect them if a deal falls apart under regulatory pressure. Covenants are being written into contracts that spell out exactly how much effort the parties will put in to push through an antitrust review, including so-called hell or high water clauses that require one or either party to do everything necessary to get approvals.

Wary Targets

When it doesnât completely halt deals, the increased scrutiny is narrowing the pool of potential buyers that make a targetâs shortlist.

Prometheus Biosciences Inc., which last month agreed to sell to Merck & Co. for $10.8 billion, decided against a competing bid from AbbVie Inc. in part because its board and advisers thought such a deal posed âsignificantly increased antitrust risk.â

One lawyer said many of his software clients wonât even contact public companies in the same industry â often seen as the most logical buyers â because they view the risk as too high. That leaves private equity firms as potential buyers, which are flush with capital but struggling to finance deals because debt has gotten more expensive.

But even buyout firms arenât being let off the hook. The Justice Department is investigating Thoma Bravoâs $2.3 billion deal to buy ForgeRock Inc., the third identity software company that the private equity firm has purchased in the past year. Thoma Bravo firm lost out to Silver Lake Management in its bid to buy Qualtrics International Inc. because of antitrust concerns, people familiar with the deal said.

âIn many cases, sellers do not want to go through that exploratory process of waiting a year to see if the deal will close,â Thoma Bravo founder Orlando Bravo said in a CNBC interview this month. âItâs taking a lot longer and people have to be a lot more thoughtful about what theyâre engaging in.â

Representatives for Thoma Bravo and Qualtrics didnât immediately respond to requests for comment.

Though most deals never make it to court, US regulators have a mixed record of success with the ones that do. Of the 17 mergers challenged in court since July 2021, seven were abandoned, while enforcers clocked up one litigated win and lost three other cases. Four remain pending, and one is on appeal. On Friday, the Justice Department proposed a mid-trial settlement in another case involving Swedenâs Assa Abloy ABâs $4.3 billion acquisition of a Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. unit.

One loss in particular is giving deal-hungry companies hope. In September last year, UnitedHealth Group Inc. won court approval for its $7.8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare Inc., defeating a Justice Department lawsuit that had sought to block the deal. And with so many cases still on the regulatorsâ books, some companies and their advisers are simply betting that the understaffed agencies wonât have the resources to tackle every big deal they try to push through.

If a company is âwilling to put in the time and resources, Iâd say go for it,â said Norton Roseâs Wait. But in the current environment, âcompanies have to think hard.â

Here Are 3 Companies Leading The Pack In This Area","Companies can allocate their funds in various ways to create shareholder value. But in the eyes of legendary investor Warren Buffett, one method stands out above all others.

âIf you do it at the right price, thereâs nothing better than buying in your own business,â the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said during his companyâs annual shareholders meeting in 2022.

Buffett was referring to stock buybacks. Basically, a company can repurchase its own shares from the open market, effectively reducing the number of shares outstanding. Consequently, the remaining shareholders get to own a larger portion of the company as their relative ownership stake increases.

He used American Express as an example to illustrate the power of buybacks.

Buffett mentioned that Berkshire purchased its last share of American Express around 1998, owning 11.2% of the payments company at the time.

âAnd now we own 20% of American Express. Thatâs whatâs happened because they repurchased shares,â he explained.

âItâs a wonderful thing if youâve got an asset you like and they take your ownership interest up.â

These days, companies flush with cash are spending billions of dollars on buybacks. Here's a look at three that are particularly generous.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)

According to S&P Global, Apple spent $94.1 billion on buybacks in 2022, up from the $88.3 billion it spent in 2021.

But it shouldnât come as a surprise. Commanding a market capitalization of $2.75 trillion, Apple reigns as the largest company in the U.S.

Itâs known for having a huge cash pile. According to the latest earnings report, Appleâs cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $166.3 billion as of April 1.

Apple also happens to be a Buffett favorite â it is the largest publicly traded holding in Berkshireâs portfolio.

Story continues

âWe knew that we would own an even greater interest if they kept buying in their shares, which â we didnât have any insider information or anything â but certainly, it would seem the way to bet,â Buffett said about Apple at Berkshireâs shareholders' meeting last year.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

As the parent company of Google, Alphabet was created in 2015 to give Googleâs wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.

S&P Global reports that Alphabetâs buybacks totaled $59.3 billion in 2022, marking an increase from the 2021 figure of $50.3 billion.

Despite being a tech behemoth, Alphabet stock has been volatile: Shares have climbed 20% in 2023 but are still down about 4% compared to a year ago.

Some consider the increasing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT a threat to Alphabet's business. But Alphabet is not standing still, as the company is also advancing its own artificial intelligence (AI) products.

âIn March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard,â Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the latest earnings conference call. âWe've since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation.â

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META)

Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms had a rough ride in 2022, and the company took advantage of the lower prices through buybacks. According to S&P Global, Meta repurchased $31.6 billion worth of its shares last year.

And now, the stock is making a comeback. Year to date, Meta shares have surged more than 80%.

A solid first-quarter report helped boost the stockâs appeal. For the quarter, the company earned a profit of $2.20 per share on $28.65 billion of revenue. Both numbers beat Wall Streetâs expectations.

Meta also continued to expand its user base. In the first quarter, Facebookâs monthly active users grew by 2% year over year, reaching 2.99 billion. Across its family of apps, Metaâs family monthly active people rose 5% year over year to 3.81 billion.

The bottom line

Remember, Buffett mentioned that buybacks should be done âat the right price.â So the fact that a company is spending big dollars on buybacks doesnât automatically make it a good investment.

Besides, there are other ways for companies to return cash to investors, such as paying a regular dividend. If your goal is to earn a steady stream of passive income, you might want to look into reliable dividend plays â both in and outside the stock market.

387,2023-05-19T14:35:03+00:00,S&amp;P 500 climbs on Google-led tech rally as easing inflation stokes Fed pause bets,"Investing.com -- The S&P 500 climbed Wednesday, as a Google-led surge in big tech helped offset losses in energy and financials after data showing cooling inflation stoked optimism on a Fed pause on rate hikes next month.

The S&P 500 was up 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, or 1 point lower, and the Nasdaq gained 1.2%.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month, in line with economistsâ estimates, but a deeper dive into the data showed a slowing in core services inflation, a key metric for the Fed.

âA slight increase in core inflation with significant deceleration on core services should encourage the Fed to keep the door open for a June hike,â Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Bets on a Fed pause in June jumped to 96% from 79% a day earlier, according to Investing.comâs Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Growing bets on a Fed pause pushed Treasury yields lower, helping rate sensitive sectors including tech rack up gains.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied.

Alphabet rose more than 4% after unveiling a string of new updates on Wednesday at its I/O developer conference including new folding smartphone and announcing that tit would be integrating generative AI into Google search.

On the earnings front, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) dominated investor attention after plunging more than 10% after downbeat guidance offset better-than-expected first- quarter revenue.

The company forecast bookings to grow more slowly than revenue in the second-quarter of the year, and the average daily rental rate would be âslightly lowerâ than a year earlier.

âWe expect shares to remain under pressure until such time as a clear path to meaningful nights reacceleration in the 2H (and into 2024) appears,â Deutsche Bank said in a note.

Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) fell more than 1% despite the video game maker reporting quarterly revenue that topped estimates as bookings returned to growth on strong demand for its FIFA game franchise.

Energy fell more than 1% as oil prices were pressured by a surprise build in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), were among the biggest decliners, with the latter also hurt by quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Financials continued to be held hostage by struggling regional banks as PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), and Comerica (NYSE:CMA), and (NYSE:LNC) led losses, while a slide in insurance firm Lincoln National Corporation also weighed.

In Washington, meanwhile, lawmakers are set to continue talks on raising the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling after discussion a day earlier yielded little progress. Hopes of immediate breakthrough remain slim as Democrats refused to accept a funding bill that will include spending cuts.

388,2023-05-19T14:31:00+00:00,Why Meta's digital ad numbers are trouncing competitors right now: Nicola Mendelsohn,"In its last earnings report, Meta's (META) ad numbers were a highlight, especially as other tech companies such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Roku (ROKU) said they remained somewhat concerned about the digital advertising market's much-talked-about slowdown.

Meta's ad revenue numbers were a notable beat, coming in at $28.1 billion versus the $26.7 billion that Wall Street was expecting. That suggests that, at least for Meta, digital advertisers are finding their way forward.

""What I'm hearing is that there's a stability out there when it comes to how [digital advertisers] are seeing things now,"" Meta's Global Business Group head Nicola Mendelsohn told Yahoo Finance at the 2023 Milken Global Conference. ""So we've gone through a real period of real fluctuation, lots of changes that people couldn't have envisaged, but I think people are now more comfortable and confident in terms of what those uncertainties are, and they're factoring them in."" Nicola Mendelsohn, Vice President of Global Business Group at Meta, speaks at the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 2, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake

Though Alphabet clocked a small beat on its YouTube ad revenue and expressed some optimism about a stabilizing ad market, that optimism didn't exist across the board. For example, in the company's earnings call, the Google parent's chief business officer Philipp Schindler noted that ""in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend.""

At Roku, it was a similar story of choppy waters in digital advertising; ad spending in some areas improved, but other areas remained pressured.

Why was Meta's story more positive? In part, it was tied to the increasing success of new products such as Reels and investments in AI, Mendelsohn said.

""[Reels is] one of our fastest growing products, and what we saw just in the last handful of months was a doubling of the amount of Reels being shared every day to 2 billion Reels being shared,"" she said. ""That's people commenting and sharing and discussing and debating and really enjoying the content that they're seeing. A lot of that has been powered by the investments that we've been making in artificial intelligence and machine learning.""

Mendelsohn also identified messaging as a key ad opportunity, especially for WhatsApp, Instagram Direct, and Messenger.

""We're seeing that one of the products that have that we call [Click to Message] actually enables advertisers to start a conversation in one of the individual threads,"" she said. ""That now has a runway of $10 billion.""

Meta's goal is, in large part, to make it easy for advertisers to use its platforms, according to Mendelsohn.

To that end, Mendelsohn also delineated how AI, a key theme that CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about in the company's latest earnings call, fits into Meta's advertising strategy.

Meta's automated Advantage+ ad products are AI-powered, and they're ""helping advertisers that want a reduction in the cost to actually reach the people that matter to them,"" Mendelsohn said. She explained that Meta, which has been using AI in one form or another since 2006, uses the technology in three ways.

""We use it to surface and bubble up the best content for you, that you, the individual among those 3.8 billion people, see the things that matter most to you,"" Mendelsohn said.

""We also use it to take content off the platform, any type of harmful content, misinformation. We're doing that through machine learning and AI,"" she added. ""Then, finally, from the advertising side and monetization of our products, then it's really about making sure we put the right products in front of the right people at the right time.""

Between Meta's AI-infused ad products and its focus on efficiency this year, some on Wall Street have taken notice.

""I don't think advertisers are doing backflips and spending money like crazy,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think what's happening is Meta has improved their ROI. ... They've been excited about the refocus of the company away from the metaverse back to the core advertising opportunity. So I think, you know, advertisers all quarter in Q1 said, 'Hey, things aren't perfect, but Meta is actually improving their competitiveness.'""

389,2023-05-19T13:03:51+00:00,"Stock market today: Dow ends lower as energy slips, but tech rides Google higher","Investing.com -- The Dow closed just below the flatline Wednesday, as a Google-led surge in big tech helped offset losses in energy and financials after data showing cooling inflation stoked optimism on a Fed pause on rate hikes next month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.1%, or 30 points lower, the S&P 500 was up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq gained 1%.

The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month, in line with economistsâ estimates, but a deeper dive into the data showed a slowing in core services inflation, a key metric for the Fed.

âA slight increase in core inflation with significant deceleration on core services should encourage the Fed to keep the door open for a June hike,â Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Bets on a Fed pause in June jumped to 96% from 79% a day earlier, according to Investing.comâs Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Growing bets on a Fed pause pushed Treasury yields lower, helping rate sensitive sectors including tech rack up gains.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rallied.

Alphabet rose more than 4% after unveiling a string of new updates including a new folding smartphone and announcing that it would be integrating generative AI into Google search.

The jump in tech helped stem losses in the broader market amid a wobble in energy and financials.

Energy fell more than 1% as oil prices were pressured by a surprise build in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles.

Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), were among the biggest decliners, with the latter also hurt by quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Financials continued to be held hostage by struggling regional banks as PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW), Comerica (NYSE:CMA), and (NYSE:LNC) led losses, while a slide in insurance firm Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC) also weighed.

On the earnings front, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) dominated investor attention after plunging more than 10% after downbeat guidance offset better-than-expected first-quarter revenue.

Story continues

The company forecast bookings to grow more slowly than revenue in the second quarter of the year, and the average daily rental rate would be âslightly lowerâ than a year earlier.

âWe expect shares to remain under pressure until such time as a clear path to meaningful nights reacceleration in the 2H (and into 2024) appears,â Deutsche Bank said in a note.

Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ:EA) fell almost 1% despite the video game maker reporting quarterly revenue that topped estimates as bookings returned to growth on strong demand for its FIFA game franchise.

In Washington, meanwhile, lawmakers are set to continue talks on raising the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling after discussions a day earlier yielded little progress. Hopes of immediate breakthrough, however, remain slim as Democrats refuse to accept debt ceiling legislation that includes spending cuts.

391,2023-05-19T11:30:00+00:00,UPDATE 3-Google I/O 2023: Search king responds to Microsoft's AI challenge,"(Recasts with executive comments and details of I/O event)

By Jeffrey Dastin and Greg Bensinger

MOUNTAIN VIEW, California, May 10 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product, hoping to create some of the same consumer excitement generated by Microsoft Corp's relaunch of rival search engine Bing in recent months.

At its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, on Wednesday, Google offered an updated version of its namesake engine. Called the Search Generative Experience, the new Google can craft responses to open-ended queries while retaining its recognizable list of links to the Web.

""We are reimagining all of our core products, including search,"" Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, said after he took the stage at the event.

He said Google is integrating generative AI into search and other products, including Gmail, where it can create draft messages, and Google Photos, where it can make major changes to images.

U.S. consumers will gain access to the Search Generative Experience in the coming weeks via a wait list, a trial phase during which Google will monitor the quality, speed and cost of search results, Vice President Cathy Edwards said.

Googleâs foray into what is known as generative AI comes after the startup OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, the darling chatbot of Silicon Valley that launched a furious funding race among would-be competitors. Generative AI can, using past data, create brand new content like fully formed text, images and software code.

OpenAI, backed by billions of dollars from Microsoft and now integrated into Bing search, has become for many the default version of generative AI, helping users spin up term papers, contracts, travel itineraries, even entire novels.

For years the top portal to the internet, Google has found its own perch in question since rivals began exploiting the technology as an alternative to presenting content from the Web. At stake is Googleâs slice of the gigantic online advertising pie that the research firm MAGNA estimated at $286 billion this year.

Story continues

In an interview, Edwards said Google's aim was to employ generative AI to reduce steps for consumers to make decisions and to let people ask a broader set of queries, including creative ones. Addressing how AI can spout incorrect information, Edwards said the company prioritized accuracy and citing trusted sources.

""AI can provide insight,"" Edward said. ""But what fundamentally people want at the end of the day is to be connected to information from real people and organizations, knowing, for example, that this health information comes from the WHO,"" or the World Health Organization.

WHAT OUTFIT TO WEAR

With the embedded AI, Google still looks and acts like its familiar empty search bar.

Generally available will be a new filter called ""Perspectives"" spotlighting blogs, videos and content from social media, the company said. Google also will mark up images the company generates with AI and make it easier for consumers to vet a picture's authenticity, it said.

But while a search for ""weather San Francisco"" will as usual point a user to an eight-day forecast, a query asking what outfit to wear in the California city prompts a lengthy response generated by AI, according to a demonstration for Reuters earlier this week.

âYou should bring layers, including a short-sleeved shirt and a light sweater or jacket for the day,â the result stated, including links to websites where it gleaned such advice.

Searches for news or to navigate to a specific website did not result in a response by generative AI, though users can prompt a chat and press a button for a follow-up query, the demonstration showed.

Bingâs search, through its partnership with OpenAI, can summarize web pages, synthesize disparate sources, compose emails and translate them. Microsoft has said every percentage point of share it gains in search advertising could draw another $2 billion in revenue.

While Bing has commanded no more than one-tenth of the search market, according to estimates, Google has practically the rest of that to defend. This means any hit to the reliability of its search engine could carry a big consequence. Generative AI programs have been found to create false or misleading results absent grounding in reliable answers.

Another challenge is the high expense of drawing on such AI, known as large language models. Edwards said, ""We and others are working on a variety of different ways to bring down the cost over time.""

Ads will remain a central part of the experience, Edwards said. ""We only get paid when there's a click.""

BARD FOR 180 COUNTRIES

In recent years, Google's rivals have taken its research breakthroughs and run with them in products, outpacing their inventor.

ChatGPT came to light after an AI system Google revealed in 2017. The speed at which the chatbot grew, however - faster than any consumer application in history - encouraged the often deliberative Google to prod staff to hurry along projects so they were ready for public consumption.

In February Google announced its competing chatbot called Bard. A promotional video that month that showed Bard answering a question incorrectly propelled a stock slide shaving $100 billion off Google's market value.

Now, Google is launching Bard in 180 countries and territories, with plans to expand its support to 40 languages, the company said.

Behind Bard also is a more powerful AI model Google announced called PaLM 2, which it said could solve tougher problems and draft better computer code.

393,2023-05-19T10:19:44+00:00,"Google Bard will work with images, more apps as company pushes generative AI","Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Wednesday announced a host of updates for its Bard generative AI chatbot during its annual I/O developer conference in Mountain View, CA. The software which is now available to more than 180 countries, will allow you to search and receive responses using images, in multiple languages, and connect to other Google apps.

The software, which is now powered by Google's Pathways Language Model 2, or PaLM 2, will allow you to do things like ask for must-see sights in New Orleans and then provide you with photos of those places. That's a major change from the early version of Bard, which only worked with text.

You'll also be able to upload images and then ask Bard to write captions for them. The company provided and example of a person uploading a photo of their dogs and then have Bard write up a few lines based on how the dogs look. Google Bard is now being used to help programmers collaborate with code. (Image: Google)

According to Sissie Hsiao vice president and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, the software's most used feature is coding. To that end, the company is rolling the ability to collaborate with code. Hsiao says that the assistant currently understands more than 20 coding languages and is adding more.

Hsiao says Bard will also help users pull together content from multiple sources. In one example she showed how a student can piece together a college application letter, and then find colleges that line up with their specific interests.

Bard can then pull those colleges up in Google Maps to help find their locations and then move all of that information into a table. You can then ask Bard to tell you which schools are public and white are private and it will automatically add them to the table, which you can then move directly into Google Sheets to collaborate with your family members.

Googleâs rival Microsoft (MSFT) is currently leading the generative AI conversation thanks to its debut of its Bing chatbot in February. Google parent Alphabet, however, has been working on generative AI for years, helping to pioneer the technology behind the software.

But Microsoftâs Bing and other generative AI releases, which come as a result of its partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, have left Google looking flat footed by comparison.

The company is now playing catch up by rolling out a number of new products using generative AI including its Bard chatbot and its generative AI capabilities in its Workspace productivity suite.

Launching later this summer as a Beta release, Magic Compose is meant to help you personalize your texts in the Messages app, allowing you to make your missives sound more concise, professional, or, weirdly, Shakespearean.

In one example, Google shows a user writing a note asking another person if they want to get dinner. They then tap the Magic Compose button and are able to choose between different styles of chatting.

For instance, if you want your dinner request to sound casual, you can select the âChillâ option and ask âYou down for some grub?â There are also options to make your text sound lyrical or exciting. Google says it will offer six types of speech out of the gate. Google's new Magic Compose will use generative AI to customize your text messages. (Image: Google)

Itâs not just Messages either. Google is also adding generative AI to its Androidâs smartphone wallpaper. Now when you open up the wallpaper customization screen, there will be an AI option that you can use to quickly change up your home screenâs style.

One example Google provided included choosing a city by the bay in a post-impressionist style. The app then popped out a painted image of San Francisco in pastel.

The company also debuted new Android 14 capabilities including the ability to customize your lock screen and make cinematic wallpapers out of still photos. The option allows you to take a standard image and, with on-device machine learning, turn it into a moving, 3D-scene that changes when you tilt or unlock your phone. That feature will land on Googleâs Pixel devices next month. Google is bringing generative AI to Android with custom AI wallpapers. (Image: Google)

397,2023-05-19T09:10:00+00:00,Google is giving its dominant search engine an artificial-intelligence makeover,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) â Google on Wednesday disclosed plans to infuse its dominant search engine with more advanced artificial-intelligence technology, a drive that's in response to one of the biggest threats to its long-established position as the internet's main gateway.

The gradual shift in how Google's search engine runs is rolling out three months after Microsoft's Bing search engine started to tap into technology similar to that which powers the artificially intelligent chatbot ChatGPT, which has created one of Silicon Valley's biggest buzzes since Apple released the first iPhone 16 years ago.

Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., already has been testing its own conversational chatbot called Bard. That product, powered by technology called generative AI that also fuels ChatGPT, has only been available to people accepted from a waitlist. But Google announced Wednesday that Bard will be available to all comers in more than 180 countries and more languages beyond English.

Bard's multilingual expansion will begin with Japanese and Korean before adding about 40 more languages.

Now Google is ready to test the AI waters with its search engine, which has been synonymous with finding things on the internet for the past 20 years and serves as the pillar of a digital advertising empire that generated more than $220 billion in revenue last year.

âWe are at an exciting inflection point,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told a packed developers conference in a speech peppered with one AI reference after another. âWe are reimagining all our products, including search.â

More AI technology will be coming to Google's Gmail with a âHelp Me Writeâ option that will produce lengthy replies to emails in seconds, and a tool for photos called âMagic Editorâ that will automatically doctor pictures.

The AI transition will begin cautiously with the search engine that serves as Google's crown jewel.

The deliberate approach reflects the balancing act that Google must negotiate as it tries to remain on the cutting edge while also preserving its reputation for delivering reliable search results â a mantle that could be undercut by artificial intelligence's penchant for fabricating information that sounds authoritative.

Story continues

The tendency to produce deceptively convincing answers to questions â a phenomenon euphemistically described as âhallucinationsâ â has already been cropping up during the early testing of Bard, which like ChatGPT, relies on still-evolving generative AI technology.

Google will take its next AI steps through a newly formed search lab where people in the U.S. can join a waitlist to test how generative AI will be incorporated in search results. The tests also include the more traditional links to external websites where users can read more extensive information about queried topics. It may take several weeks before Google starts sending invitations to those accepted from the waitlist to test the AI-injected search engine.

The AI results will be clearly tagged as an experimental form of technology and Google is pledging the AI-generated summaries will sound more factual than conversational â a distinct contrast from Bard and ChatGPT, which are programmed to convey more human-like personas. Google is building in guardrails that will prevent the AI baked into the search engine from responding to sensitive questions about health â such as, âShould I give Tylenol to a 3-year-old?â â and finance matters. In those instances, Google will continue to steer people to authoritative websites.

Google isn't predicting how long it will be before its search engine will include generative AI results for all comers. The Mountain View, California, company has been under intensifying pressure to demonstrate how its search engine will maintain its leadership since Microsoft began to load AI into Bing, which remains a distant second to Google.

The potential threat caused Alphabet's stock price to initially plunge, although it has recently bounced back to where it stood when Bing announced its AI plans to great fanfare. More recently, The New York Times reported Samsung is considering dropping Google as the default search engine on its widely used smartphones, raising the specter that Apple might adopt a similar tactic with the iPhone unless Google can show its search engine can evolve with what appears to be a forthcoming AI-driven revolution.

Alphabet's shares surged 4% Wednesday after Google's wave of AI announcements to finish at $111.75, the highest closing price since Bing began melding with ChatGPT in early February.

As it begins to ingrain AI in its search engine, Google is aiming to make Bard smarter by connecting with the next generation of a massive data set known as a âlarge language model,â or LLM, that fuels it. The LLM that Bard relies on is dubbed Pathways Language Model, or PaLM. The AI in Google's search engine will draw upon the next-generation PaLM2 and another technology known as a Multitask Unified Model, or MUM.

Although people will have to wait to see how Google's search engine will deploy generative AI to find answers, a new tool soon be more broadly available to all users. Google is going to add a new filter called âPerspectivesâ that will focus on what people are saying online about whatever topic is entered into the search engine. The new feature will be placed along existing search filters for news, images and video.

Besides using its annual tech showcase to tout its prowess in AI, Google also unveiled the first foldable smartphone in its Pixel line-up of gadgets. Googleâs entry into a new type of smartphone design that allows users to deploy the device as a mini-tablet too comes nearly three years after Samsung â the leading maker of smartphones powered by Googleâs Android software â introduced its first bendable model.

Foldable phones so far have remained a niche market, largely because of prices ranging between $1,500 and $2,000. Last year, about 14 million foldable phones were sold worldwide, accounting for just 1% of overall smartphone shipments, according to the research firm International Data Corp.

Google's foldable Pixel phone will sell for $1,800 and begin shipping next month. It will unfold with a hinge and, of course, be packed with AI."
398,2023-05-19T09:06:00+00:00,"Google Enters Foldable Market With $1,799 Pixel Phone to Rival Samsung","(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.âs Google introduced a $1,799 foldable smartphone, a new entry-level Pixel phone and a tablet for the home, its latest attempt to spark hardware sales in an arena saturated by Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.

Launched at Wednesdayâs Google I/O conference, the Pixel Fold is Googleâs first entry into the growing foldables category and comes with a 7.6-inch main display and a 5.8-inch external panel. Google touts this as the thinnest foldable in the markets where it will be sold, which include the US, UK, Germany and Japan.

The company also rolled out its first Pixel-branded tablet and a $499 Pixel 7a, trickling down its 2022 flagship phoneâs features to a more affordable price point. The three devices use an in-house chip known as the Tensor G2.

The move into the pricier foldables category marks a strategy shift for Google, which has so far focused on undercutting the cost of rival devices. The Pixel Fold is Googleâs most expensive handset to date, matching the price of Samsungâs latest Galaxy Z Fold 4 and including high-end specifications like 512 gigabytes of onboard storage. Samsung remains the sales leader in foldables â with 79% of the market last year, according to IDC â having kicked off the category four years ago with the Galaxy Fold.

Foldables make up only 1% of smartphone shipments. IDC estimates shipments will more than triple from 2022, to roughly 50 million units annually, by 2027. That would still be under 4% of the market, but would account for a $42 billion slice because they fetch higher prices.

Story continues

âFoldables are a pricing dream,â said Neil Mawston, director of research at Strategy Analytics. âWe predict foldables will account for an outsized 5% of all smartphone wholesale revenues worldwide this year.â

In a presentation, Google said that its foldableâs distinguishing features are its screen technology and cameras. The company has built a library of AI-powered camera features â such as its Magic Eraser, which can remove unwanted elements in photos for a neater composition â that it says make its hardware a leader. Still, Samsungâs comparable foldable device has slightly better image sensor specifications.

Foldable phones typically have an external display for quick tasks and can fold open to a tablet-sized interior screen. Googleâs Pixel Fold is wider than Samsungâs latest model, users of which have complained that itâs narrowness makes it harder to use. The Pixel Fold also includes features like face unlock, a fingerprint scanner and a promised 24 hours of battery life.

Google boasted that its deviceâs hinge is more durable than those on competing products and that over 50 of its own apps are optimized for the foldable display.

Google is also banking on two more conventional devices as it attempts again to make headway in the hardware market. The Pixel 7a looks like last yearâs Pixel 7, but uses more basic components and trims back the list of features. Its screen is 25% brighter than the preceding model and has a faster, 90-hertz refresh rate. Thereâs also face unlock, enhanced camera zoom, and a 64-megapixel rear camera, making it one of the more compelling low-end smartphones.

A year after announcing the product, Google shared more details about its tablet. The deviceâs specifications â including the companyâs G2 processor, 128GB of storage, 8MP front and rear cameras and hardware design â are by this point dated compared with rival devices. Its price â $499 â also eclipses some iPad models, though the Google device includes a home dock to stand it upright. While docked, the device will be geared toward video watching, controlling appliances and viewing photo slideshows.

CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the show emphasizing AI as the show's lead theme. For Gmail, the company is introducing a new feature called ""Help Me Write,"" which serves as a more advanced version of Smart Compose.

""Let's say you got this email that your flight was canceled,"" Pichai told the audience. ""The airline has sent a voucher, but what you really want is a full refund. You could reply and use 'Help Me Write.' Just type in the prompt of what you want, an email to ask for a full refund, hit 'create' and a full draft appears.""

So, it was all AI, all the time at Google I/O, including for one of the company's most visible products outside Search, Google Workspace â a suite of productivity products that includes apps like Google Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, and Google Drive.

According to Google, the suite will now feature Duet AI, a generative AI-based feature that helps users write, pull information from existing documents, and more.

For example, Google Slides will now have a feature that helps create speaker notes out of an existing slide show. Similarly, Google Sheets will have a ""Help Me Organize"" feature in which users can describe what they want to do, and then the feature will generate a plan to accomplish that goal. Pappu speaking at Google I/O, May 10, 2023.

Google Workspace General Manager Aparna Pappu explained what this process might look like on stage at Google I/O.

""Imagine you run a dog-walking business and need to keep track of things like your clients' logistics about their dogs, like what time they need to be walked, how long, etc.,"" she said. ""Sheets can help you get organized. Simply type something like 'client and pet roster for a dog-walking business with rates' and hit 'create.'""

401,2023-05-19T00:57:05+00:00,Brazil's crusading justice Moraes ratchets up fight with global tech giants,"By Ricardo Brito

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The head of Brazil's electoral authority, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, delivered a stern warning to the world's top tech companies on Wednesday, saying he would not let them undermine Brazil's democracy.

Moraes' comments - which included the assertion that global tech giants ""believe no jurisdiction in the world can oversee them"" - reflect growing global debates about whether the firms are doing enough to police their platforms.

They also constitute an ambitious new battle line for Moraes, a judge whose previous crusades have included squaring up to far-right former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's efforts to undermine the country's electoral system during last year's presidential election.

""The big tech platforms have been challenged and they will be penalized. They will be held accountable, to guarantee the voter's freedom to vote,"" Moraes told judges and public servants studying electoral law, without naming any specific firms.

Shortly after his speech, Moraes threatened to suspend and fine messaging app Telegram nationwide unless it complied with an order to remove criticism it had made on its platform about a major bill seeking to control the spread of disinformation online.

Telegram subsequently took down the message, saying in a statement that the Supreme Court had ordered it to tell users that its message had ""distorted"" the debate in ""an attempt to induce and instigate users to coerce lawmakers.""

Brazil is among countries taking a global lead in pressuring tech giants to crack down harder on users it sees as spreading disinformation.

Moraes has already fined Telegram once this year for failing to comply with a court order that called for accounts of Bolsonaro supporters to be frozen, and ordered the suspension of the app last year in a ruling that was revoked days later.

DISINFORMATION BILL

Dubbed the ""Fake News Law,"" the internet regulation bill seeks to put the onus on internet companies, search engines and social messaging services to find and report illegal material, instead of leaving it to the courts, and proposes hefty fines for failures to do so.

Story continues

Global tech firms have campaigned against the bill, arguing it would open the door to censorship. It would also endanger free services on their platforms if they are obliged to pay content providers and for copyright on material posted on their sites, they say.

Last week, Alphabet's Google added a link on its search engine in Brazil connecting to blogs against the bill and asking users to lobby their representatives.

Brazil's government and judiciary said such actions amounted to undue interference in the congressional debate.

Justice Minister Flavio Dino said: ""The law must prevail over the digital Far West"" and he gave Google two hours to remove the link or face a big fine.

Google pulled it in minutes, while defending its right to communicate its concerns through what it called ""marketing campaigns"" on its platforms.

Facing a wave of criticism from conservative lawmakers, who say the government plan is to censure its opponents, and lacking support in the lower house, the bill was taken off the fast track last week and there is no date for it to be put to the vote.

402,2023-05-18T22:15:52+00:00,"Google unveils the Pixel Fold: a $1,799 foldable smartphone","Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted its Pixel Fold smartphone at its annual I/O developers conference in Mountain View, CA. on Wednesday. The phone, whichâhold your breathâwill cost $1,799, is Googleâs first foldable handset, and its first ultra premium device. The company also revealed its low-cost Pixel 7A at the show.

Like Samsungâs Galaxy Z Fold 4, the Pixel Fold opens up like a book, allowing users to take advantage of its front display, or its larger tablet-like inner screen. Google says the Pixel Foldâs 5.8-inch external display should feel just like a standard smartphone screen whether surfing the web or checking TikTok.

That would be a sharp contrast from Samsungâs Z Fold, which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsungâs offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen. Google has debuted its new Pixel Fold. The foldable phone starts at $1,799. (Image: Google)

Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to consumers whoâve balked at Samsungâs bulky Z Foldâs design.

Around back, youâll find the Pixel Foldâs telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, along with its wide-angle and ultrawide angle cameras. Up front, Google has outfitted the Pixel Fold with a 9.5 megapixel selfie camera, which does double duty as the phoneâs Face Unlock camera. A second selfie camera over the inner display allows you to make video chats via the large 7.6-panel. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

As far as performance goes, the Pixel Fold is powered by Googleâs custom Tensor G2 chip and 12GB of RAM. You can opt for 256GB or 512GB of internal storage. Battery life? Google says the Pixel Fold will get more than 24 hours of use out of a single charge. Weâll have to see how those claims stand up in real life, though.

All of those specs and numbers are top notch, but what do they actually do for you? The Pixel Fold, like the Z Fold, is meant to provide users with a tablet experience in a compact package. The idea is to give a large canvas to browse the web, watch videos, play games, and take and edit photos.

Story continues

During my time with the Z Fold, however, I noticed that I spent much of my time using the outer display, rather than taking the time to unfold it and use the inner screen. Maybe Iâm just lazy, but I simply preferred the outer screen.

Thatâs not to say there arenât some interesting uses for foldable devices. Google, for instance, touts the Pixel Foldâs ability to let users drag and drop content between an app running on one side of the inner screen and another app running on the other side. You can also easily multitask by running two apps side by side. The Pixel Fold unfolds into a large 7.6-inch screen. (Image: Google)

You can also use the Pixel Fold in tabletop mode to watch movies and TV shows or make video calls hands free.

If you prefer reading ebooks, the Pixel Fold is also a solid bet, as it will provide a larger display than a regular non-folding phone. But is all of that worth $1,799? It depends on your priorities.

For Google, and its parent Alphabet though, one thing is clear: itâs not ditching its hardware line anytime soon. Despite low market share compared to leaders Apple and Samsung, Google is seemingly dedicated to its Pixel line as a means of diversifying its revenue streams outside of the advertising space. Google says the Pixel Fold is the thinnest foldable phone on the market. (Image: Google)

In its 2022 10K form, Alphabet said its Google other business, which is made up of its hardware and Google Play sales as well as YouTube subscriptions, brought in $29 billion in revenue for the year, up from $28 billion in 2021. Still, thatâs a drop in the bucket compared to Googleâs advertising revenue of $224.5 billion in 2022.

The Pixel Fold is also coming to market at a time when consumers are purchasing fewer smartphones as high interest rates and inflation batter electronics sales. Still, the fold doesnât need to be a market leader to be a success. It simply needs to help Google gain greater share in the space. But when your main competitors are Apple and Samsung, thatâs no easy task.

Pixel 7A coming for $499

On the other end of the pricing spectrum is Googleâs Pixel 7A. A low-cost follow-up to last yearâs Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the Pixel 7A starts at $499 and packs a 6.1-inch display with an up to 90Hz refresh rate for smooth on-screen animations.

The phone offers two rear cameras, wide-angle and ultra-wide angle, and features many of the same software capabilities as Googleâs pricier handsets. That includes Magic Eraser, which allows you to easily remove unwanted objects from your photos, and Photo Unblur, which, well, unblurs photos.

Like the Pixel Fold and Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, the Pixel 7A gets Googleâs custom Tensor G2 chip, as well as 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. The company also promises battery life will last more than 24 hours during regular use and up to 72 hours on Extreme Battery Saver mode.

By Carolina Mandl and Shristi Achar A

May 10 (Reuters) -

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes rose on Wednesday, helped by a slightly lower-than-expected increase in April inflation and Alphabet Inc's latest artificial intelligence rollout.

The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 4.9% in April from a year ago, compared with expectations of a 5% increase, raising hopes that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking cycle is close to an end. Month-over-month CPI in April rose 0.4% after gaining 0.1% in March.

""Markets reacted positively because they saw the inflation data as a small positive,"" said Michael Harris, president at hedge fund Quest Partners LLC. ""The Fed is in a pause now. They've done their last rate hike and they're going to wait and see for the next couple of months.""

The lower-than-expected inflation data drove the Nasdaq Composite Index up as much as 1.17% to its highest intraday level in more than eight months.

The Nasdaq was helped by a climb in Alphabet as the company rolled out more artificial intelligence for its core search product in response to competition from Microsoft Corp .

Large-cap tech stocks including Apple Inc and Microsoft also gained.

The rate-sensitive S&P 500 technology sector index and the communication services rose.

""The CPI is indicating some sort of relief in inflationary pressure. That would mean the Fed would be toward the end or already at the end of its interest rate cycle, and growth companies are most heavily affected by higher interest rates,"" said Kevin W. Philip, a partner at investment advisor Bel Air.

Growth companies rely more on borrowed money so they benefit from lower rates.

Fed funds futures traders are pricing in a pause in rate increases at the central bank's June meeting, and less than a 5% chance of another 25 basis point hike.

Story continues

""The market is pricing in a Fed cut beginning this summer. While inflation is decelerating, it's not decelerating at a pace that would justify cutting the Fed funds rate anytime before the fourth quarter of 2023,"" said Matthew Palazzolo, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management.

Indexes were choppy during the session, as investors digested the positive inflation print with concerns about the looming debt ceiling.

Talks on raising the U.S. federal government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling entered a new phase on Wednesday as some areas of potential compromise emerged after Tuesday's White House meeting.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 17.93 points, or 0.44%, to end at 4,137.10 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 124.68 points, or 1.04%, to 12,304.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.45 points, or 0.10%, to 33,528.36.

Regional bank shares extended declines from volatile sessions last week on concerns about the sector's health. PacWest Bancorp and Zions Bancorporation inched lower.

Oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp fell after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' estimates.

Livent Corp rose after Australian lithium miner Allkem Ltd agreed to merge with the U.S.-based chemical manufacturing firm to create a $10.6 billion firm.

Airbnb Inc lost as the vacation rental booking company had fewer bookings and lower average daily rates in the second quarter.

Rivian Automotive jumped after the electrical vehicle maker beat estimates for its first-quarter results and reiterated its annual production forecast.

411,2023-05-18T17:34:18+00:00,Google to launch AI search engine,"Instead of simply providing a list of links, Google will feature more elaborate text answers and explanations, generated by AI, at the top of its search results.

Google is revamping its 25-year-old internet search engine with artificial intelligence (AI) and features akin to a digital chatbotÂ in a race against upstart rival OpenAI.

The $1.4 trillion internet giant unveiled a taste of the biggest redesign in its search engineâs history at its annual conference, featuring a âconversationalâ interface in addition to its now ubiquitous search bar.

While the search bar - which has hardly changed since Google first launched it - is not going away, users will be able to engage in question-and-answer-style chats with it.

Instead of simply providing a list of links, Google will feature more elaborate text answers and explanations, generated by AI, at the top of its search results.

For example, users looking for inspiration for travel, recipes or shopping can ask Google to generate ideas for them.

The new features pit Google against rival tech giant Microsoft, which is working with start-up OpenAI to reinvent its own internet search technology. Google, which first launched its search engine in 1998, has been scrambling to keep up as Microsoft unleashed its own wave of AI products. Google unveiled a taste of the biggest redesign in its search engineâs history at its annual conference in California - JOSH EDELSON/AFP

Tech companies are betting that people will want more in-depth and nuanced internet search answers. However, the developments are likely to add to fears that users will rely on search engines for increasingly in-depth answers, rather than turning to internet publishers or newspapers.

Among other AI tools that were trailed by Google were updates to its separate Bard chatbot, which will soon launch in dozens of languages and feature the ability to create and edit code or generate synthetic images. Intended to rival ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI that has exploded in popularity, Bard will also be opened up beyond a trial phase to millions of internet users.

The tech giant confirmed the release of the new tools despite fears a proliferation of fake images could fuel misinformation. There have also been questions over the accuracy of the current generation of AI algorithms, which are able to produce convincing-sounding text but often make factual mistakes.

Story continues

The new version of Google Search will not initially be the default option for all users. Instead, it will be part of a new experimental version of Google, called Search Labs, where users can opt to try out its ""Search Generative Experience"".

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google-parent company Alphabet, said the tech giant was taking a ""bold and responsible approach"" with AI while ""reimagining our core products, including search"".

In a blog post, David Gasca, product management director, said many of the experimental tools ""will eventually be integrated into Google Search"".

Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said: ""The euphoria around ChatGPT has reignited interest in AI and has been a wake-up call for all. Expect developments in this area to heat up and represent a hotbed for innovation as the battle for supremacy among big tech intensifies.""

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of todayâs research reports here >>>

Shares of Alphabet have gained +11.3% over the past six months against the Zacks Internet - Services industryâs gain of +11.8%. The companyâs strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. An expanding data center network and a rising number of infrastructure regions will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.

Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques, and growing interest in home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Further, Alphabetâs expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.

Alphabetâs growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. However, sluggishness in the companyâs advertisement business remains a major headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.

(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)

Procter & Gambleâs shares have gained +10.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industryâs gain of +12.8%. The company continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the third consecutive quarter in its fiscal Q3 recently reported. However, sales and earnings declined year over year.

Procter & Gambleâs organic sales grew, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Consequently, it raised the sales view to 1% growth compared with our estimate of a 1.1% rise for fiscal 2023.

However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation. As a result, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023. Also, an unfavorable currency has been concerning.

(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)

Shares of Alibaba have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+16.1% vs. +4.8%). The companyâs solid momentum across the international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. The Zacks analyst expects the business to be up 9.1% in fiscal 2023 on a year-over-year basis.

Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, education and automobile industries is driving the companyâs cloud business. According to our estimates, cloud revenues are expected to witness a 3.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022. This apart, strength across the local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well.

However, uncertainties associated with Covid-related issues in its home country remain major concerns, especially domestically. Also, rising expenses associated with new initiatives are overhangs. Additionally, softness in digital media business is a headwind.

The company did little to hide that it would be launching a tablet, but it finally confirmed the launch and provided all specifications during Wednesday's Google I/O event. The Pixel Tablet is an 11-inch tablet powered by Google's latest Tensor G2 chip and starts at $499, which pits it between Apple's 10th generation iPad -- which starts at $449 but is powered by an older A14 bionic chip -- and Apple's iPad Air, which has Apple's high-performing M1 chip but starts at $599.

418,2023-05-18T15:59:02+00:00,Explainer: How is the new Google AI search different from Bard chatbot?,"By Anna Tong

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Wednesday demonstrated an updated core search product that embeds more AI in its answers as the company looks to banish doubts that it is losing ground to Microsoft Corp's OpenAI-powered Bing search.

Google already has a Bard chatbot that competes with ChatGPT, the chatbot from OpenAI that has generated huge excitement among users with its humanlike responses.

SO WHEN DO YOU GOOGLE AND WHEN DO YOU BARD?

The company says that traditional Google search should still be used for finding and seeking information, such as locating something to purchase.

Bard is a chatbot with a persona that can hold humanlike conversations, and is intended to be used for creative collaboration, for instance, to generate software code or write a caption for a photo.

WHAT ARE THE UPDATES TO GOOGLE SEARCH?

With the enhanced search termed the Search Generative Experience, Google's home page still looks and acts like its familiar search bar.

The difference is in the answers: if the new Google detects that generative AI can be used to answer a query, the top of the results page will show the AI-generated response. The traditional links to the Web will remain below.

For example, a search for ""weather San Francisco"" will as usual point a user to an eight-day forecast, while a query asking what outfit to wear in the California city prompts a lengthy response generated by AI, according to a demonstration for Reuters earlier this week.

""You should bring layers, including a short-sleeved shirt and a light sweater or jacket for the day,"" the result stated, including links to websites where it gleaned such advice.

Users will also be able to enter a brand-new ""conversational mode,"" which similar to Bard and ChatGPT remembers the user's prior questions so users can ask follow-ups more easily.

However, the company points out that conversational mode is not designed to be a chatbot with a personality; it is intended only to help hone search results. For example, its responses will never contain the ""I"" phrase, unlike Bard and ChatGPT.

Story continues

CAN I TRY THE NEW GOOGLE SEARCH NOW?

Not yet. U.S. consumers will gain access to the Search Generative Experience in the coming weeks via a wait list, a trial phase during which Google will monitor the quality, speed and cost of search results, the company said.

CAN I TRY BARD NOW?

The company said on Wednesday that Bard is now available with no wait list in 180 countries and territories, and plans to expand its support to 40 languages.

On Wednesday, Google started introducing more to the public â slowly.

At its annual developer conference, Google unveiled a version of its search engine that uses large language models, AI tools that are trained on enormous volumes of text to answer usersâ queries conversationally. The update will exist only in a new, experimental space dubbed âSearch Labs,â which users who sign up for a wait list will be able to access. Certain features may eventually graduate to the main search engine; others will be scrapped entirely.âThey want to be in the generative AI game, and they have to be in the generative AI game,â said Evelyn Mitchell, an analyst with Insider Intelligence. âThere are new competitive dynamics emerging around AI, and they have to address it, whereas before maybe it wasnât so important.â

The approach insulates Google from some of the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI, while also buying the company more time to assess the impact on its search advertising business, which is the main revenue driver for its parent company Alphabet Inc.

Itâs a more risk-averse stance than the one being taken by Microsoft, which has already infused its search engine, Bing, with technology from the startup OpenAI, and made the tools widely available to the public. With an estimated 93% percent of the worldwide search market, Google has more to lose. The company is also trying to be thoughtful about how to set expectations with users about the capabilities of generative AI, Prabhakar Raghavan, a senior vice president at Google, said in an interview ahead of the conference.

Story continues

âOne of the defining questions for me is, how do you delineate what these things can and cannot do in a way that's understandable to users, to businesses? Or to the ecosystem at large?â Raghavan said. Either way, investors were optimistic: Alphabet shares rose 4.4% to $111.75, outperforming the Nasdaq.

Read More: Here are the AI products Google launched during its I/O conference

Since the launch last year of OpenAIâs popular chatbot, ChatGPT, people are increasingly experimenting with using AI tools to offload time-consuming tasks, such as party planning or product research. Raghavan described the example of mapping out a trip to Paris, which requires cross-checking the hours of operation of local establishments â a task that could easily trip up an AI system. Asked whether Googleâs generative AI search product, known as SGE â short for âsearch generative experienceâ â could field such a project, Raghavan responded: âSomeday.â

If the AIâs answers come easily and sound confident, people may believe them without checking facts. âWe want it to be trustworthy for users to do that application,â Raghavan said. âToday, we are not there.â

Googleâs presentation suggested there are still many ways the company can use generative AI to help consumers in the meantime. In its search labs, Google is focusing on helping users accomplish tasks that are âclunkyâ in the current version of the search engine, requiring multiple queries, said Liz Reid, a vice president of search.

âWe think generative AI is sort of the next evolution of search, and it can help supercharge search,â Reid said in an interview.

There are limits to how far Google will go. For highly sensitive queries, such as suicide, Googleâs generative AI tools will not engage, Reid said. (The company will instead display information about suicide prevention.) Searches about other topics, such as health and finance, will come with a disclaimer that the responses should not be used as advice.

""We know that even with all of this, we will still make mistakes,â Reid said. âThatâs why we are launching it in Search Labs and trying to be very clear in the messaging and on the product that this is still very much experimental.â

Google has previously tested new search features by introducing them to randomized groups of users. By rolling out Search Labs, Google hopes to engage in a more robust dialogue with users about generative AI, Reid said. Users will be able to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to provide feedback on results, and the company will review potential policy violations using âa combination of humans and automation,â Reid added.

Despite these precautions, some experts on tech ethics have expressed concern that itâs not enough for companies to start by rolling out nascent technologies to smaller groups of users â they must take other steps to mitigate harmful effects to people, especially those in underrepresented and minority groups, which can be particularly vulnerable when new technology emerges.

Tech giants like Google that invest heavily in research have long faced questions about when to share their findings with the academic community and when to focus on weaving technological advances into products. The company is currently âfine-tuningâ its approach, especially in the fast-moving field of generative AI, Raghavan said.

âI fully expect we will continue to contribute to the computer science community, but we will probably continue to look even harder at moving things into product rapidly,â Raghavan said.

Asked about whether generative AI is here to stay, Raghavan cited its âblack boxâ nature â referring to the idea that people who build these AI models donât always understand why they spit out one answer versus another. âThese things are very opaque,â he said. âSo there is conceivably a black swan event lurking in there that we havenât seen yet, thatâs so terrible, you know, we all take a deep breath.â

Google is in a riskier position because it âhas an established reputation already,"" said Mitchell, the Insider Intelligence analyst. ""If they screw anything up, it is big news.â

As the technology moves forward, Google will be vigilant to ensure that the benefits to users from generative AI outweigh the harms, Raghavan said. âFor now, studies, user tests are showing that theyâre gaining value from this,â Raghavan said. âAnd that, to us, is a North Star.â

420,2023-05-18T13:45:00+00:00,UPDATE 1-Brazil's crusading justice Moraes ratchets up fight with global tech giants,"(Adds fresh comment from Telegram paragraphs 7-8)

By Ricardo Brito

BRASILIA, May 10 (Reuters) - The head of Brazil's electoral authority, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, delivered a stern warning to the world's top tech companies on Wednesday, saying he would not let them undermine Brazil's democracy.

Moraes' comments - which included the assertion that global tech giants ""believe no jurisdiction in the world can oversee them"" - reflect growing global debates about whether the firms are doing enough to police their platforms.

They also constitute an ambitious new battle line for Moraes, a judge whose previous crusades have included squaring up to far-right former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's efforts to undermine the country's electoral system during last year's presidential election.

""The big tech platforms have been challenged and they will be penalized. They will be held accountable, to guarantee the voter's freedom to vote,"" Moraes told judges and public servants studying electoral law, without naming any specific firms.

Shortly after his speech, Moraes threatened to suspend and fine messaging app Telegram nationwide unless it complied with an order to remove criticism it had made on its platform about a proposed internet regulation bill seeking to control the spread of disinformation online.

Telegram subsequently took down the message, saying in a statement that the Supreme Court had ordered it to tell users that its message had ""distorted"" the debate in ""an attempt to induce and instigate users to coerce lawmakers.""

Later, Telegram said ""it would likely no longer be able to continue working in Brazil if the law were passed with the proposed wording.""

""While we complied with the order to remove our messages, Telegram stands behind its analysis and believes that laws that will affect the lives of tens of millions of people require public attention and a reasonable period of debate,"" it said.

Story continues

Brazil is among countries taking a global lead in pressuring tech giants to crack down harder on users it sees as spreading disinformation.

Moraes has already fined Telegram once this year for failing to comply with a court order that called for accounts of Bolsonaro supporters to be frozen, and ordered the suspension of the app last year in a ruling that was revoked days later.

DISINFORMATION BILL

Dubbed the ""Fake News Law,"" the internet regulation bill seeks to put the onus on internet companies, search engines and social messaging services to find and report illegal material, instead of leaving it to the courts, and proposes hefty fines for failures to do so.

Global tech firms have campaigned against the bill, arguing it would open the door to censorship. It would also endanger free services on their platforms if they are obliged to pay content providers and for copyright on material posted on their sites, they say.

Last week, Alphabet's Google added a link on its search engine in Brazil connecting to blogs against the bill and asking users to lobby their representatives.

Brazil's government and judiciary said such actions amounted to undue interference in the congressional debate.

Justice Minister Flavio Dino said: ""The law must prevail over the digital Far West"" and he gave Google two hours to remove the link or face a big fine.

Google pulled it in minutes, while defending its right to communicate its concerns through what it called ""marketing campaigns"" on its platforms.

Facing a wave of criticism from conservative lawmakers, who say the government plan is to censure its opponents, and lacking support in the lower house, the bill was taken off the fast track last week and there is no date for it to be put to the vote.

With Alphabet Inc.âs Google launching the Pixel Fold at an event Wednesday, every major brand running the Android operating system has now adopted the form factor. And though Apple began early work on a foldable iPhone years ago, itâs shown little interest in racing a product to market.

The approach isnât unusual for Apple, which often takes its time and then jumps into an established category with a more polished product. That was the case with the iPhone itself in 2007. The company also has less incentive to tinker with its current iPhone lineup since it dominates the market for premium smartphones.

But Apple could soon find itself years behind rivals in a promising segment. Though foldable phones are still a tiny fraction of the market, they command higher prices and open the door to new features, helping lower-tier brands step up into the premium range. Market observers expect the segment to be the fastest-growing area in an otherwise shrinking smartphone field.

The question is whether Apple will ultimately help solidify the foldables concept or miss out on it, said Neil Mawston, director of research at Strategy Analytics.

âApple has the power to make or break the future foldables industry,â he said. âLaunch too early, and a market-unready foldable could trash the whole iPhone franchise. If Apple does not have a foldable iPhone or iPad on sale by 2025, when industry revenues will approach tens of billions of dollars, then weâd start to get a little worried.â

Story continues

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, didnât immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company makes the majority of its revenue from the iPhone lineup â which is incrementally improved annually and hasnât made major leaps in design or function for years. So far, foldables have yet to reach large enough volumes to take meaningful share away from Apple, which controlled 77% of the market for phones above $751 last year, according to Omdia analyst Jusy Hong.

For now, foldables are an Android-only contest, dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. on the global stage. But competition is more intense in China, where local brands are using such devices to go upscale. Xiaomi Corp., Huawei Technologies Co., Vivo and Oppo each have several models on the market now. Honor, an independent brand spun off from Huawei in 2020, is also helping make the segment more affordable with its Honor Magic Vs device this year.

Chinese brands face increasing pressure to differentiate their products and encourage users to upgrade, especially as the broader phone industry stalls. The domestic smartphone market suffered double-digit shipment declines over the past year. And unlike Apple, which has fostered a virtuous cycle of customers upgrading their iPhones every couple of years, the more fungible Android brands have to win customers anew with every new device. A foldable option helps do that.

Thatâs evident at a company like Oppo, the largest smartphone maker in China.

âFoldables are the future and are of utmost importance to Oppoâs overall product strategy,â said Billy Zhang, president of overseas sales and services at Oppo. His sentiment is echoed by Honor, which expects China to be the first market where foldables start to lead the premium segment. Close collaboration with local suppliers helps improve portability and affordability quickly, according to an Honor spokesperson, and 90% of the top 5,000 apps in China have already been adapted for foldable devices.

The development of foldable devices is capital-intensive, as it requires the design and refinement of hinges that are durable and thin. There are further innovations required, such as Samsungâs ultrathin glass screen cover, which allows for the familiar glass-like feel on a surface thatâs able to bend and flex.

Googleâs involvement in the foldable segment had until this week been limited to software. The Alphabet-owned company is responsible for developing Android and has been collaborating with Samsung since the 2019 introduction of the first Galaxy Fold handset to make the operating system and its apps work with such devices. Its own Pixel Fold may provide welcome competition to Samsung, which still enjoys a first-mover advantage and a 79% share of the global market, according to IDCâs Bryan Ma.

For Apple, its first entry into this category is more likely to be a tablet than a foldable iPhone, according to mobile industry veteran and CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood and Omdiaâs Hong. Wood expects a âsuper-premium iPad with a flexible displayâ in 2024. Hong, meanwhile, sees the crease in the middle of foldable screens as a major obstacle to Appleâs adoption. That imperfection is much improved since first-generation Samsung devices, but it lingers even in the latest models. And the iPhone maker is famously demanding in its choices of display technology.

âIt is unthinkable that Apple has not been experimenting with flexible display technology in its product development labs for a decade or more,â Wood said. âThe strength of the existing iPhone portfolio and the high margins it commands obviates the need for Apple to react to rival folding smartphone devices.â

Over the last year Moscow has levied dozens of fines against Western tech companies as part of a drive to ramp up control over what Russian internet users see online.

As well as passing strict censorship laws shortly after it dispatched troops into Ukraine, Russia also last year strengthened its laws against what it calls the ""promotion of LGBT propaganda"".

Under the new law, which widens Russia's interpretation of what qualifies as ""LGBT propaganda"" and has been heavily criticised by independent human rights groups, any action or the spreading of any information that is considered an attempt to promote homosexuality in public, online, or in films, books or advertising, could incur a heavy fine.

Russian prosecutors said Google had refused to remove several videos posted on YouTube, including one from a blogger deemed a ""foreign agent"" by Moscow about how same-sex couples raise children and about the LGBT community in St. Petersburg, the TASS news agency reported.

The Russian subsidiary of Alphabet's Google filed for bankruptcy last year after authorities seized its bank accounts following a December 2021 fine of 7.2 billion roubles ($92.6 million) over what Russian authorities said was the company's ""repeated failure"" to delete content.

426,2023-05-18T10:25:00+00:00,Google's ChatGPT rival Bard is still missing in Hong Kong after opening up to 180 countries and territories,"Google has opened its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Bard to ""over 180 countries and territories around the world"", but Hong Kong is not among them.

Google said on Wednesday that it has removed the wait list for Bard, which was launched in March this year with limited access for users in the US and the UK. The tech giant has now nixed the wait list in most parts of the world, it announced at its I/O developer conference, with plans to integrate it into search after Microsoft made a similar move with ChatGPT.

Google did not publish a complete list of territories where Bard is available, but like ChatGPT, it cannot currently be used in Hong Kong. Attempts to access the service on Thursday were met with a message saying that ""Bard isn't currently supported in your country. Stay tuned!""

Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.

In a blog post about the expanded service on Wednesday, Google said more countries and territories are ""coming soon"".

When asked about Bard's absence in Hong Kong, Google did not address its plans for specific markets. ""Bard is in its early days - and given how new the technology is, we want to roll it out thoughtfully and responsibly,"" a Google spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, does not make its services available in Hong Kong, either. The company lists 163 markets where it is available. Many of the places not listed are either sanctioned or exhibit tight internet controls, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and China.

However, both Bard and ChatGPT can be accessed through the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), although OpenAI has taken extra steps such as blocking some VPN connections and requiring a phone number to create an account.

Story continues

As in mainland China, some people in Hong Kong have been using third-party services with access to OpenAI's application programming interface (API). As a result, generative AI tools have proven popular in the city.

Still, the lack of official support for the hottest new AI products appears to undercut the city's efforts to position itself as a super connector and international financial centre. While Google is blocked by the Great Firewall in mainland China, the company's other services from search to email are widely used in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong operates as a separate customs territory from the mainland under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, but in 2020, then-president Donald Trump revoked the city's preferential trade status with the US.

In recent years, Google has been butting heads with local authorities. After Beijing imposed a national security law on the city, Google stopped directly responding to data requests from Hong Kong police, instead directing them to go through ""diplomatic procedures"".

Last year, Google also came under fire from local authorities for refusing to change its ""organic"" search results that put ""Glory to Hong Kong"", a song associated with the 2019 protests, as the top result for Hong Kong's ""national anthem"". The song has been repeatedly played mistakenly at sporting events instead of the Chinese anthem ""March of the Volunteers"".

According to Google's latest transparency report covering the second half of 2022, the Hong Kong government requested that the company remove 183 items for the period, mostly from YouTube. Google only complied with about half of the requests.

As Google looks to expand the use of its AI bot, it is also adding new language support. Bard can now be used in both Japanese and Korean, in addition to English, and will support more than 40 languages soon, the company said.

Google landed on those two languages as the first for expanded support by ""truly listening to user feedback"" about ""the areas that people are most excited to engage"" in, Bard product lead Jack Krawczyk said during an online media briefing last week.

By comparison, ChatGPT can already be used in dozens of languages, including Chinese, although the sophistication of its answers can vary depending on the language used.

Google also introduced a slew of new AI features across different products on Wednesday, including adding new capabilities to Google Cloud and Workspace.

Bard initially got off to a rocky start in February when Google debuted it with a limited beta. Shares of Google parent Alphabet tumbled after an ad showed Bard responding to a question with an incorrect answer, amid fears that it was losing ground to Microsoft.

The latest updates now appear to be generating some optimism for Bard's future, with Alphabet gaining 4.4 per cent on Wednesday.

Not yet, but US users can join a waitlist for the trial, which Google is calling an âexperiment.â First you have to sign up for a new AI testing ground called Search Labs, which opened on May 10. In âcoming weeksâ Search Labs will open access to trial the new search function Google calls âSearch Generative Experienceâ (or SGE). Access will be available on Chrome desktop and through the Google App on IoS or Android.

Are there ads in Googleâs AI-powered search?

There was no mention of ads at the demo, something Bing has already brought onboard to its AI revamp. Ads in the new AI search are still in the experimental phase, according to a report from The Verge, and are likely to make an appearance down the line as they remain Googleâs top source of revenue.

The potential impact, and risks, of Googleâs AI search update

While still in its trial phase, Googleâs venture into AI search marks the first step in a potentially radical change in how billions of users find information. Currently, Google holds over 80% of the global search market, and draws an average of 3.5 billion searches daily, according to InternetLiveStats.

Google has been cautious about being too hasty in the debut of AI technology, a move that head of Googleâs AI division, Jeff Dean, said carries âreputational risk.â

The tech giant has likely grown even more cautious since it launched ChatGPT rival Bard in February. Google posted a demo of the AI chatbot on Twitter, not knowing that it gave a wrong answer in the video. The blunder wiped $100 billion from the companyâs market value in a day. Investors reacted positively to the I/Oâs announcements, lifting Alphabetâs shares by 4% and reaching a 9-month high.

429,2023-05-17T21:39:10+00:00,Trending tickers: Disney | Rolls-Royce Holdings | Alphabet | ITV,"Disney+ streaming subscribers fell by 4 million, hitting 157.8 million versus expectations for 163.17 million. Photo: Getty.

Disney (DIS)

Disney reported second-quarter earnings which broadly met analystsâ expectations on the top and bottom line. However Disney+ streaming subscribers fell by 4 million, hitting 157.8 million versus expectations for 163.17 million.

It sent the companyâs shares down almost 5% after-hours as investors seemingly disregarded a stronger performance in its parks, experiences and products division which enjoyed 17% revenue growth to $7.7bn, mostly thanks to strong sales in its theme parks.

Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor said: âAfter a tough 2022 in which the stock shed over 40%, Disney shares have enjoyed a significant recovery this year, thanks to the broader rebound in growth stocks, significant restructuring including 7000 job cuts, as well as Bob Igerâs return as CEO.â

However, Scholar noted, the earnings highlight the intense competition in the streaming wars amid an onslaught of incumbent and new entrants in the sector.

âDisney has also been dealing with a political battle with Floridaâs governor Ron DeSantis, a drop in Disney+ Hotstar revenue in India and a writersâ strike which has impacted some of its productions,â she added.

Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L)

In London, Rolls-Royce Holdings stock was down nearly 4% on Thursday despite the group saying it was on track to to meet guidance for operating profit of between Â£800m and Â£1bn this year.

The company also said flying hours hit 83% of pre-pandemic levels in the first four months of 2023.

âShares in Rolls-Royce have enjoyed an incredibly strong year so far, rallying over 50% amid optimism towards the new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic and a strong earnings performance last year thanks to the recovery in international aviation post covid,â Victoria Scholar said.

âErginbilgic has been spearheading a major transformation programme which has reinvigorated the engine makerâs bull case. He also recently appointed a new CFO, in another sign that he is making his mark. In January when he was appointed CEO, Erginbilgic described Rolls Royce as a âburning platformâ,â she added.

Story continues

Rolls Royce is the FTSE 100âs best performing stock over the past six months, although the stock is still trading at less than half of its value from its 2018 peak and is giving back some of those gains today.

Alphabet (GOOG)

Investors continue to watch Alphabet stock after the group announced it was rolling out more artificial intelligence (AI) for its core search product, in the hope it will create some of the same excitement generated by Microsoft Corp's update to rival search engine Bing in recent months.

At its annual I/O conference in California on Wednesday, the Google and YouTube parent company revealed a new version of its namesake engine, called the Search Generative Experience.

It said the revamped Google can craft responses to open-ended queries while retaining its recognisable list of links to the web.

""We are reimagining all of our core products, including search,"" Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive said at the event.

The AI update comes after the company reported first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. It also authorised a $70bn stock buyback.

Alphabet stock climbed as much as 5% in after hours trading on the news.

ITV (ITV.L)

Shares in ITV were down nearly 5% after the British broadcast giant said a tough advertising market would continue in the April to June period as a lack of major events and economic uncertainty dampens company spend.

In its quarterly update, trading was in line but it guided its total advertising revenue (TAR) for the second-quarter to be 12% lower, putting it behind current analyst forecasts.

However, ITV pointed to an improvement in the third-quarter with the return of its popular reality show and a world sports event that will boost ad spend again.

""We are looking forward to Q3 with Love Island and the Rugby World Cup set to draw large broadcast and streaming audiences,"" the group said.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the latest update from ITV comes as TV advertising faces both a structural challenge, as the audience for linear television declines, and a cyclical challenge as companies trim their advertising spend thanks to an uncertain economic outlook.

""This was reflected in free-to-air broadcaster ITV's first quarter trading update which, not unexpectedly, showed a big decline in advertising revenue and signalled a weak showing on this front in the current quarter too.

""Advertising spend on its digital platforms is proving more resilient but not sufficiently so that it can make up for the drop off elsewhere,â he said.

Mould further noted that the ITVX platform, which he said created a real stink with shareholders when it was unveiled just over a year ago, seems to be performing well.

""The production business, seen for several years as a route to reducing ITV's reliance on volatile advertising spend, is growing at a decent lick. However, the company is struggling to pass on rising production costs.

""In the recent past there was real clamour for content as streaming platforms engaged in a battle royale to claim subscribers. Now, however, media firms are striving to be more parsimonious as investors look for a greater measure of financial discipline,"" Mould added.

At 11:44 ET (15:44 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 227 points or 0.7%%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.1%.

Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares fell 8.2% after it reported Wednesday evening, saying subscribers to its streaming business fell in the quarter. Shares of PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) fell 23% after it disclosed deposits dropped 9.5% in the May 5 week.

Growth in consumer prices slowed again in April from a year earlier. Evidence that inflation is cooling is encouraging the view that the Federal Reserve is going to pause its interest rate hiking campaign in June after raising rates by a quarter of a percentage point last week.

Also encouraging that view: Initial jobless claims came in slightly higher last week than expected, at 264,000 versus expectations for 245,000. And producer prices rose slightly less than expected in April, at 2.3% from last year versus expectations for 2.4%.

Stocks have risen this year as investors anticipate the Fed will start reversing course and cut rates during the second half of the year.

An outstanding issue is the resolution of the debt ceiling fight in Washington, where lawmakers are fighting over whether to attach spending cuts as a condition to raising the limit. Biden administration officials have warned that the government might run out of options to pay its obligations as early as June 1 if Congress fails to raise or suspend the limit.

Alphabet Inc. Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares rose 4.8% after Google showcased several artificial intelligence projects that it sees helping it compete in the fast-moving space against competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others.

Top Analyst Reports of Alphabet, Procter & Gamble and Alibaba

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., The Procter & Gamble Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today's research reports here >>>

Shares of Alphabet have gained +11.3% over the past six months against the Zacks Internet - Services industry's gain of +11.8%. The company's strong cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. An expanding data center network and a rising number of infrastructure regions will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.

Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques, and growing interest in home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Its deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Further, Alphabet's expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well.

Alphabet's growing efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. However, sluggishness in the company's advertisement business remains a major headwind. Additionally, its growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are concerns.

(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)

Procter & Gamble's shares have gained +10.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry's gain of +12.8%. The company continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the third consecutive quarter in its fiscal Q3 recently reported. However, sales and earnings declined year over year.

Procter & Gamble's organic sales grew, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. It has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. Consequently, it raised the sales view to 1% growth compared with our estimate of a 1.1% rise for fiscal 2023.

However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation. As a result, the company retained its drab earnings view for fiscal 2023. Also, an unfavorable currency has been concerning.

(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)

Shares of Alibaba have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+16.1% vs. +4.8%). The company's solid momentum across the international commerce retail businesses is driving its top-line growth. The Zacks analyst expects the business to be up 9.1% in fiscal 2023 on a year-over-year basis.

Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, education and automobile industries is driving the company's cloud business. According to our estimates, cloud revenues are expected to witness a 3.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022. This apart, strength across the local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well.

However, uncertainties associated with Covid-related issues in its home country remain major concerns, especially domestically. Also, rising expenses associated with new initiatives are overhangs. Additionally, softness in digital media business is a headwind.

The partnership between SAP SE and the cloud unit of the internet giant will help customers in a range of industries, from supply-chain and inventory management to marketing and commerce, said Google Cloud Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian.

âWe are bringing the power of data and the power of AI,â Kurian said in an interview. âItâs a joint effort between our two companies to drive business transformation using this information.â

Google Cloud is one of the biggest bets for growth at parent Alphabet Inc. as the companyâs core internet search and advertising businesses matures. Google trails Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in the market for cloud computing, but the unit had its first profitable quarter earlier this year. Googleâs prowess in AI is seen as a key way that the company can set itself apart in the cloud.

SAP, Europeâs largest software company, has been making moves in recent quarters to sharpen its focus on its fast-growing cloud business.

Kurian said the partnership would help with âharmonizingâ data sets. For instance, if a store manager needed to make sure a branch was well-stocked, that manager could use a chatbot created with Google Cloud tools to query inventory for an order.

Christian Klein, SAPâs CEO, said any of its customers could take advantage of the partnership and choose to use Google Cloudâs AI tools.

Though he noted that SAP has partnerships with other companies in cloud, âthis is for sure now the front runner,â Klein said in an interview.

But is it really a seismic development or just overhyped tech? Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban falls resolutely in the former camp. Having recently waded in on the conversation, Cuban has said the techâs potential is âbeyond anything Iâve ever seen,â comparing ChatGPT to HTML and the early days of the internet.

Cubanâs advice to companies is simple: get in on the AI game or risk becoming a dinosaur. âThere are two kinds of companies in the world, Those who are great at AI, and everyone else,â Cuban opined.

Of course, some companies are already ahead of the curve and are making huge investments in AI to catch a significant chunk of this potentially mega-huge industry. With this in mind, we used the TipRanks database to get the lowdown on two names working hard on the AI front who get the endorsement of Wall Streetâs analysts. Letâs take a deeper look.

Alphabet (GOOGL)

Given its investment in ChatGPT, Microsoft is considered to have gotten a head start in the AI arms race, but Alphabet is not about to throw the towel in. Googleâs parent company has its fingers in many pies â from the core search engine business to YouTube to the Android operating system and self-driving car firm Waymo â but has also made significant investments in AI over the years.

Recent headlines have been about its ChatGPT retort, its chatbot Bart, but you can trace the beginning of the companyâs serious AI journey to the 2015 acquisition of AI research company DeepMind. Alphabet has invested in several other AI startups and companies, while it also operates an AI research lab called Google AI, which is focused on developing new AI technologies. More recently, the firmâs late-stage venture capital arm, CapitalG led a $100 million investment in corporate data company AlphaSense.

Story continues

And this week, the companyâs Google I/O 2023 developer event took place, where the company announced new AI-powered features for its products and services, such as Google Search and Android and launched new hardware products, such as the Pixel Fold foldable smartphone and a Pixel tablet.

If investors were previously concerned about Alphabet losing ground to Microsoft, following the event, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak puts those fears to rest.

âGoogle I/O showcased GOOGLâs strong long term AI competitive position across search, the developer community and productivity apps,â the analyst said. âAI is reshaping all of GOOGLâs products faster than expected as many of its newly announced AI features/products are rolling out over the coming weeks and months. Its speed of innovation and go-to-market motion are improving, which should make investors feel more comfortable about GOOGLâs long term positioning despite recent competitive concerns. Successful integration of these new AI features into Googleâs 6 products that serve over 2bn users, and 15 products that serve more than 500mn users should build further confidence in AI driven upside to come.â

To this end, Nowak rates GOOGL shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) while his $140 price target makes room for one-year returns of 25%. (To watch Nowakâs track record, click here)

No one on Wall Street seems to have a problem with that assessment. All 29 recent analyst reviews on GOOGL are positive, naturally resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $129.50 average target, the shares will climb ~16% higher over the one-year timeframe. (See GOOGL stock analysis)

Five9 (FIVN)

The AI opportunities are not the preserve of only Big Tech. Smaller companies are in the game too, ones such as Five9, a leading CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) company. Five9 provides cloud-based contact center software to businesses with the software designed to help organizations improve customer experience and increase productivity while reducing costs. The offerings include omnichannel routing, IVR (interactive voice response), speech recognition, workforce management, and reporting and analytics.

Five9 uses AI and machine learning tech to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its contact center software and the AI capabilities are integrated into various features of their platform, including automated chatbots, speech recognition for customer self-service and predictive analytics.

Going by the recent Q1 report, the business is in good health. Revenue climbed by 19.5% year-over-year to $218.4 million, beating the Streetâs forecast by $10.42 million. Adj. EPS of $0.41 also trumped the $0.24 expected by the analysts. For the full year 2023, the company sees revenue hitting the range between $906.0 to $909.0 million, some distance above consensus at $902.61 million.

Despite the strong results, Five9 shares have been on the backfoot this year, and that is partly down to fears that the rise of AI could actually make services like the ones Five9 offers redundant.

Au contraire, says Piper Sandler analyst James Fish, who highlights the positive noises made by the company on the matter.

âWhile bears point to ChatGPT/ LLM technology as a headwind to the space, management confirms our AI thesis, noting adoption of AI is both accretive to revenue and the CCaaS TAM overall,â Fish wrote. âAI is acting as the main catalyst behind most of Five9âs large wins. New logo resilience remains with Five9âs pipeline hitting new highs and up 2x Y/Y, with further forward stability coming from a meaningful acceleration in long-term RPO, and management looking to continue to hire across the organization to support the pipeline.â

âWe believe these recent pullbacks provide opportunities for shareholders to buy into this strategic space that is an AI beneficiary, with a favorable competitive landscape, conservative 2023 guide, & large-deal catalysts on the horizon,â Fish went on to add.

What does this all mean for investors? Fish rates FIVN an Overweight (i.e., Buy), along with an $89 price target. Thereâs plenty of upside â 63% to be exact â should the target be met over the next 12 months (To watch Fishâs track record, click here)

Most of Fishâs colleagues are on the same page. Based on 13 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. A year from now, shares are anticipated to change hands for ~58% premium, considering the average target clocks in at $86.24. (See FIVN stock forecast)

442,2023-05-17T13:00:00+00:00,"From PaLM to Sidekick, Google serves up a 'smorgasbord' of AI","By Greg Bensinger

(Reuters) -Google announced a flurry of artificial intelligence products â but users might need AI just to understand them all.

The Alphabet Inc unit on Wednesday demonstrated or referenced at least 15 different AI products and features ranging from software solely for creating smartphone wallpaper to another for organizing personal files to yet another for photo editing.

Attendees of Googleâs I/O conference in Mountain View, California, could be forgiven for leaving the annual event with their heads spinning. Take one of Google's press releases from the event: âDuet AI serves as your expert pair programmer and assists cloud users with contextual code completion, offering suggestions tuned to your code base, generating entire functions in real-time, and assisting you with code reviews and inspections.â

For what seemed like every one of Googleâs myriad products, the company had a distinct AI aide. Those wishing for snappier text messages can turn to a new assistant called Magic Compose that can transform more mundane prose into something sounding like William Shakespeare. If thatâs not mellifluous enough, Googleâs new MusicLM AI can make literal music out of text. Or thereâs Sidekick to help you compose better documents in Google Docs. The companyâs Perspectives AI finds personal stories from videos, blogs and social media posts to augment answers to search queries.

A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

âThere was a lot of buzzwords and a lot of different products,â said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. âI call it a smorgasbord.â

If the two-hour keynote felt like a word salad, there were nonetheless meaty business needs behind the buffet of announcements. Investors agreed, sending the company's shares up 5.5% on Thursday to a nine-month high.

Google is in a heated race with rival Microsoft Corp to maintain its sizable lead in search and the estimated $300 billion total market for ads. Microsoft garnered accolades for adding generative AI, provided by startup OpenAI, alongside its Bing search engine to answer more nuanced questions and saw an initial uptick in market share as a result.

Story continues

Google responded Wednesday by showing off what it calls the search generative experience. According to a demonstration, that will satisfy the very specific cohort of web surfers who are seeking the best red e-bikes for a 5-mile (8-km) commute with hills. Search generative experience is not to be confused with Googleâs direct competitor to OpenAIâs ChatGPT chatbot known as Bard.

And there was much, much more: med-PaLM 2, Vertex AI, sec-PaLM, Gemini, Project Tailwind, Codey, Chirp, Duet AI for Google Workspace and Duet AI for Google Cloud.

443,2023-05-17T12:03:00+00:00,Wendyâs CEO on new Google-powered drive-thru: You wonât know âitâs AI taking your orderâ,"You won't hear the friendly voice of Wendy's (WEN) CEO Todd Penegor booming through the burger chain's new AI-powered drive-thrus.

""You wonât even know that itâs AI taking your order, but youâll be talking to the voice of Wendyâs,"" Penegor said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above), quipping: ""It's not my voice, God help us.""

But over time, you will likely hear a welcoming automated voice from a ginormous digital monitor at Wendy's drive-thru. And that may unlock some fatter profits â and a beefier stock price â for the square-burger seller.

Wendy's will officially roll out an automated drive-thru in June at a company-owned spot in its home market of Columbus, Ohio. The digital ordering screen will be powered by natural language software cooked up by Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

Google's software is designed to understand how consumers order from the menu, meaning it stands to make compelling suggestions to buy more. That's better known in restaurant land as ""upselling"" a customer. Wendy's will be rolling out its new AI-powered drive-thrus in Columbus, Ohio.

The technology will also go a long way to improving food quality at Wendy's and drive-thru times, which may prove to be welcome news to hungry, hurried fast-food diners.

""Now we're really thinking about how do we take some of the friction and make the experience even more seamless at our restaurants,"" Penegor explained of the initiative. ""How do we set our employees up to be in a position to succeed and make their lives a little bit easier in the restaurant? Get them positioned to work the grill station? Get them positioned to make hot and juicy hamburgers fast and accurate every time? That's what we're trying to do.""

Wendy's will probably look to automate more of its drive-thrus to keep pace with technological changes in generative AI and an evolution in how diners are interacting with the Frosty King.

Penegor is bullish on the potential, of course. He said the company is thinking through how to make a smarter digital menu board, connect it to Wendy's loyalty program, create more personalized menus, and get consumers to trade up their purchases.

""Those are all opportunities,"" Penegor explained. ""A little further off, obviously, but you got to start laying the pipework in the platforms today to really bring all of that to life."" Welcome to the Wendy's automated drive-thru, may I take your order? (Wendy's)

For Wendy's, its AI initiatives add another good story to tell investors after a mixed year of performance in 2022.

Wendy's said on Wednesday its US same-store sales increased by 7.2% in the first quarter on the back of premium-priced burgers. Higher menu prices played an important role too.

Customer count grew each month of the quarter. Meanwhile, international same-store sales surged 13.9%.

Wendy's stock rose 1% on Thursday morning. The stock is up 1.6% year to date compared with a 7% gain for the S&P 500. McDonald's (MCD) has gained 11.7% on the year amid sizzling sales globally.

To keep growth going and jumpstart the stock price, Penegor told Yahoo Finance that Wendy's will expand its late-night hours this summer, promote breakfast items more, and introduce new premium-priced sandwiches.

The Street is on board with all of that as possible stock price catalysts.

""The 1-on-1 marketing deployment, digital and loyalty program expansion, increased staffing and speed of service, and late night day-part extensions are just too attractive to be yielding only a flat traffic in the next 2 years (guidance),"" Wendy's bull and Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo wrote. ""With this outstanding potential, the stock trading at its 5-year low valuation and with a dividend yield of 4.4%, we can't possibly be neutral on the stock.""

Penegor thinks near-term fundamentals are where investors should be focused on right now, with automated drive-thrus as more of a future earnings driver.

""We are not an AI stock,"" Penegor added. ""I see us as an innovation company.""

The S&P 500 was fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9%, or 310 points lower, and the Nasdaq gained 0.2%.

Regional banks remained in the firing line as PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) slumped 20% after reporting that deposits fell 9.5% for the week ended May 5, keeping fears of a deeper bank run front and center.

For the second day in a row, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) led the climb in big tech as the tech giantâs announcement that it would incorporate generative artificial intelligence into products including search drew positive remarks from Wall Street.

âShowcasing tight integration of Bard into other Google products (Maps, travel, Workspace, Gmail, etc) may flip the narrative that Google is behind and moving too slowly,â UBS said in a note.

Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) early investment in ChatGPT, however, gives it a âkey head start on the AI frontâ¦with Google now playing major catchup mode,â Wedbush said in a note.

Falling Treasury yields, meanwhile, continued to support growth stocks like tech higher as bets on a Fed rate cut were supported by data showing further signs of easing inflation and a pick-up in jobless claims.

The producer price index for April rose 0.2%, slower than the 0.3% economists had expected, and slowed to 3.2% on an annualized basis from 3.4% in March.

Weekly  initial jobless claims, meanwhile, rose by 22,000 to 264,000 for the week ended May 5. That was the highest since October 23.

If next weekâs jobless claims come in at a similar level to today, they would be 18,000 higher than the prior survey week, implying âslower payroll growth and lower household employment as well,â Jefferies said in a note.

By Greg Bensinger

May 11 (Reuters) - Google announced a flurry of artificial intelligence products â but users might need AI just to understand them all.

The Alphabet Inc unit on Wednesday demonstrated or referenced at least 15 different AI products and features ranging from software solely for creating smartphone wallpaper to another for organizing personal files to yet another for photo editing.

Attendees of Googleâs I/O conference in Mountain View, California, could be forgiven for leaving the annual event with their heads spinning. Take one of Google's press releases from the event: âDuet AI serves as your expert pair programmer and assists cloud users with contextual code completion, offering suggestions tuned to your code base, generating entire functions in real-time, and assisting you with code reviews and inspections.â

For what seemed like every one of Googleâs myriad products, the company had a distinct AI aide. Those wishing for snappier text messages can turn to a new assistant called Magic Compose that can transform more mundane prose into something sounding like William Shakespeare. If thatâs not mellifluous enough, Googleâs new MusicLM AI can make literal music out of text. Or thereâs Sidekick to help you compose better documents in Google Docs. The companyâs Perspectives AI finds personal stories from videos, blogs and social media posts to augment answers to search queries.

A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

âThere was a lot of buzzwords and a lot of different products,â said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. âI call it a smorgasbord.â

If the two-hour keynote felt like a word salad, there were nonetheless meaty business needs behind the buffet of announcements. Investors agreed, sending the company's shares up 5.5% on Thursday to a nine-month high.

Google is in a heated race with rival Microsoft Corp to maintain its sizable lead in search and the estimated $300 billion total market for ads. Microsoft garnered accolades for adding generative AI, provided by startup OpenAI, alongside its Bing search engine to answer more nuanced questions and saw an initial uptick in market share as a result.

Google responded Wednesday by showing off what it calls the search generative experience. According to a demonstration, that will satisfy the very specific cohort of web surfers who are seeking the best red e-bikes for a 5-mile (8-km) commute with hills. Search generative experience is not to be confused with Googleâs direct competitor to OpenAIâs ChatGPT chatbot known as Bard.

And there was much, much more: med-PaLM 2, Vertex AI, sec-PaLM, Gemini, Project Tailwind, Codey, Chirp, Duet AI for Google Workspace and Duet AI for Google Cloud.

452,2023-05-17T04:39:41+00:00,AWS and Microsoft Azure dominate cloud computing. But could Google Cloud beat them in Web3?,"On a rainy evening in late 2021, James Tromans, now the head of Web3 at Google Cloud, sat in his London apartment, a loft conversion within a 19th-century, red-brick building.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Tromans called into a meeting with Google Cloud executivesâa 45-minute blitz where he and two others each led 15-minute presentationsâand fielded a flurry of questions on his topic: decentralized methods to verify digital identity.

At that moment, the crypto market was still flying high, and Tromansâs presentation was directly related to Web3, which led to a murmur among those in the meeting that they needed to review the blockchain ecosystem in more detail. âWell, hey, like, we can do that,â he remembers telling the executives.

A few months later, the cloud computing giant did âdo that,â first unveiling in January 2022 its digital assets team, its Web3 sales unit, and then, in May 2022, its Web3 engineering team, which focuses on product, strategy, and research. The brains behind Google Cloudâs push into blockchain, Tromans was named head of the cloud providerâs Web3 division.

Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, two titans of cloud computing, have similarly dipped their toes into blockchain technology. But since Google Cloudâs first foray into Web3 last year, a flurry of public partnerships and products suggest it may be emerging as an early frontrunner.

And despite the headwinds facing the blockchain industry since the collapse last year of several high-profile companies, Tromans says Google Cloud is committed to the technology. âThis isn't just a marketplace-type play,â he told Fortune. âWe're in it.â

'A capitalistic adjustment'

Tromans has always found himself âplaying around at the edge of new technology,â he told Fortune. Before A.I. was âcool,â he received a doctorate in computational neuroscience from the University of Oxford. And then, years later, shortly before he was an executive at Citibank, he learned about Bitcoin and blockchain. (In fact, heâs still caught up in the bankruptcy proceedings for Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange and which collapsed after losing cryptocurrency now worth billions of dollars.)

Story continues

Tromans left his role at Citi, where he managed a team, for Google Cloud, where he at first worked under its CTO, partly because he wanted to âhave that freedom to explore new technology again, get [his] hands a bit dirty.â And it was that impulse that led him to present on digital identity during the âgenesisâ meeting that brought forth Google Cloudâs current Web3 team.

The tech giantâs cloud computing arm had previously explored Web3 in 2018 when it added datasets for Bitcoin and then other blockchains into BigQuery, a means for developers to access large databases, but its Web3 strategy accelerated after Tromans took the helm.

Since then, the division has announced a stream of partnerships with prominent crypto firms and blockchains. First, it trumpeted a series of tie-ups with Nansen, a blockchain analytics company, BNB Chain, Coinbase, and slew of other blockchaincompanies and protocols. It also launched the Blockchain Node Engine, a method for developers to access and use blockchains on Googleâs servers. And most recently, it unveiled a startup program for Web3 companies.

âOne dynamic Iâm seeing in the cloud market as of late is that they're all trying to out-partner,â Melanie Posey, research director for cloud services at 451 Research, a division of S&P Global Market Intelligence, told Fortune.

Google Cloudâs recent prominence in crypto trade publications implies that its investments in Web3 far outstrip Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azureâa surprising reversal of the pecking order among big cloud providers, where Google has long trailed. (In the first quarter of 2023, AWS controlled 32% of the cloud computing market share, Azure had 23%, and Google Cloud ranked third with 10%, according to Synergy Research Group.)

Andrew Boone, a managing director at JMP Securities who follows the tech sector, says that the competition between AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud can't be easily distilled into a horse race, pointing out that most large corporations now look to use multiple cloud providers.

""I think it was just a capitalistic adjustment,"" he said, referring to the cloud providers' exploration of Web3. ""They see an opportunity, and there's people who need cloud services, and so they formed a verticalized team.""

Microsoft Azure declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. âMore customers trust AWS for their blockchain and ledger technology workloads than any other cloud vendor,â an AWS spokesperson said in a statement.

Tromans also declined to wade in on the specifics of a rivalry. âWhilst I do definitely keep abreast of what everyone's up to, I won't speak to their strategies,â he told Fortune.

Whatâs next?

Since the âgenesisâ meeting in 2021 that launched Google Cloudâs Web3 team, crypto has endured its most fraught period since the early days of Bitcoin.

The market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, which reached almost $3 trillion in 2021, has plummeted to whatâs now approximately $1.2 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. A series of high-profile crypto firms have collapsed, most notably the now-bankrupt exchange FTX. And in the past few months, the U.S. federal government has filed a suite of civil and criminal charges against crypto heavyweights, including Binance, the largest exchange by far.

Tromans says he has always maintained a healthy skepticism of blockchain, but that he has no plans to abandon the technologyâand neither does Google Cloud. âNo matter how cynical you try and be, you come back to the fact that there's something there thatâs innovative and that is still exciting people and is driving value,â he told Fortune.

The cloud computing giant has recently grown its Web3 engineering team, plans to further expand the number of blockchains it supports, and hopes to make its Blockchain Node Engineâwhich currently only supports Ethereum, Solana, and Polygonâgenerally available.Â âWhere things go in three years from now, it starts to get murky,â Tromans added.

What seems certain, however, is that, as long as he has the opportunity, Tromans will continue to explore the âtechnological edge,â whether thatâs A.I., blockchain, or something else entirely.

âI just always,â he told Fortune, âhave found myself there.â

The internet revolution gave rise to the communication services industry that keeps growing, evolving and innovating. The communication services industry is a huge area where small and large players are vying for user attention and to become the consumerâs top priority to communicate with others, consume and share media. Edward Jones in an August 2020 report noted several important trends to watch out for in the communication services sector, which the firm at the time said accounted for about 10% of the S&P 500. Edward Jones said that consumers are quickly making a shift from traditional TV to online streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)+. The streaming revolution that was at its peak during August 2020 (when the report was published) has not stopped showing its impact as several companies in the communication services industry have since launched their streaming services to compete with others. The report also noted that consumers were ditching cable and satellite TV services for online subscription services that also offer traditional TV channels. Some notable names in this area were Dish and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL)âs YouTube.

One of the biggest growth catalysts and areas of competition for companies in the communication services sector has been advertising. The Edward Jones report noted that as consumers begin to consume text, audio and video online, the growth projections for the advertising industry, especially for 2021, were solid. While the reportâs rosy predictions for 2021 proved to be true, the inflation crisis that started in 2022 added a lot of uncertainty in the equation. The communication services industry is currently struggling with advertising growth as inflation hammers consumers and small businesses, causing a slowdown in the industry. According to data from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), in 2022, digital advertising revenue jumped 10.8%. This growth was significantly down from the 35% growth reported in 2021. IAB expects this growth to further slow down in 2023 given the current economic situation. However, the firm believes the industry will continue to adapt to the changes as it has done in the past. Some new avenues of opportunities for the industry include video, AR, VR and artificial intelligence.

IABâs CEO David Cohen said:

â2023 promises to be a challenging year. But this industry, more than most, is galvanized by change. The job now is identifying where the areas of growth are going to be, follow the consumer and develop solutions that meet and exceed their needs.â

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) earlier this year posted solid growth for its ads revenue, surprising many. As the Federal Reserve aims to pause rates hikes and some foresee inflation getting under control, the communication services sector might be set for strong growth in the future.

The communication services sector has took a beating in 2022 as the sector was weighed down by stocks like Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter (before it went private), Netflix and more. However, the sector is posting a decent performance this year, with S&P 500 Communications Services Sector Index having gained about 23% year to date through May 8.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18

Washington-based internet service company Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) ranks 13th in our list of the best communication services stocks to buy now. Cogent Communications Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CCOI) is in the spotlight after the company raised its quarterly dividend by 1.1%.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27

Arizona-based broadband communications services provider Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) ranks 12th in our list of the best communication services stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Earlier this month Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) posted Q1 results. GAAP EPS of $9.62 missed estimates by $4.44. Revenue in the quarter totaled $421.8 million but missed estimates by $1.14 million.

Out of the 27 hedge funds that had stakes in Cable One Inc. (NYSE:CABO) as of the end of the fourth quarter, Gardner Russo & Gardner of Tom Russo was the biggest stakeholder with a $64 million stake in the company.

Atai Capital made the following comment about Cable One, Inc. (NYSE:CABO) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âCable One, Inc. (NYSE:CABO is a rural broadband provider with the majority of their footprint consisting of Coaxial rather than Fiber. For those unfamiliar with Cable One (Sparklight Internet), you can compare them to their larger, more well-known peers like Charter (Spectrum) or Comcast (Xfinity).

There are however some important distinctions to make; unlike Charter and Comcast, they started to pivot away from TV subs back in 2013, and thus, their EBITDA margins are higher than the rest of the industry (~53% for CABO versus ~40% for Charter). This is because TV subs are basically a zero-margin business and contributed only ~25% of residential revenue for Cable One in 2022 but ~42% for Charter (lower margin, but still profitable for Charter). Funnily enough, I have been shocked at how often cable bears bring up TV subs as a concern on these names, not realizing they contribute nothing to the bottom line and are just a drag on margins. Another contributing factor to Cable Oneâs higher margins is their industry leading ARPUs (Average revenue per user), which should continue to grow moving forwardâ¦â (Please click here to read the full text)

456,2023-05-16T18:32:29+00:00,Google can now match Microsoft in party planning A.I.âand a whole lot else. But will it be enough?,"Google is notârepeat notâceding party planning to Microsoft.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

When Microsoft wanted to demonstrate how it was infusing generative A.I. into its popular business productivity software through its Copilot feature, Sumit Chuan, who leads the companyâs Office Product Group, showed off how it helped her plan a graduation party for her daughter, generating ideas for themes, helping to write invitations, creating a slide show of photos to play at the event, and creating to-do lists and spreadsheets to track progress as the date of the event approaches.

So it was amusing that in a press briefing last week for reporters to preview all the cool A.I.-enabled stuff that Google was about to unveil at Google I/O, its annual developer conference, Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Bard, Googleâs A.I. chatbot rival to Microsoftâs Bing and OpenAIâs ChatGPT, noted how he used Bard to help write birthday party invitations for his son.

What does it say about the hype surrounding this technologyâand about the home lives of Silicon Valley executivesâthat generative A.I.âs real killer use case is apparently planning your kidâs party? Beyond that, the dueling party planning case studies are illustrative of a pattern that has emerged in the Google-Microsoft rivalry: Microsoft announces an A.I.-powered feature and Google quickly matches it, maybe announces a few incremental advances of its own, but doesnât manage to debut a breakthrough product that fundamentally alters the competitive landscape in the way that Microsoft's embrace of OpenAIâs technology late last year did.

That was basically the story of yesterdayâs Google I/O keynotes: Google announced no fewer than 25 new features that are powered by its latest large language model, PALM 2. It will write emails for you! Populate spreadsheets! Create slideshows! Bard is available in Japanese and Korean as well as English! Bard can input and output images now too! And it can code! (Although it may not do anything of these things as well as Bing or ChatGPTâaccording to some early side-by-side comparisons.)

Story continues

It all seems like cool and useful stuff, but fairly incrementalâand a lot of it merely ensures Google keeps pace with what Microsoft and an increasing slew of other competitors are offering. It was telling that one of the biggest applause lines of the I/O keynotesâat least from the livestream I was watchingâwas the announcement that Bardâs user interface now supports a âdark mode.â The ability to display colored text on a black background rather than dark text on a light background? Life changing, apparently.

The announcement that has far more potential to prove game changing in the long run is what Google is doing with search. But here Googleâs cautionâit is wary of tampering with the engine that powers about 80% of its revenuesâis tempering any sense of just how radical the change could be, especially for companies, such as media organizations, whose businesses rely heavily on search traffic. Google emphasized throughout I/O yesterday that it wants to be both âbold and responsibleâ in its implementation of A.I. And not moving too fast, especially when it might undermine the business models of reliable information sources, seems to be part of that responsible element.

For now, Google is only launching what it is calling an âexperimentalâ A.I.-powered search product that it calls SGE as part of a new sandbox for testing A.I. tools and features it calls Google Search Labs. Users will have to sign up for a waitlist at first and the product will only be available in the U.S. and in English initially. Sissie Hsiao, a Vice President at Google and General Manager for Google Assistant's business unit, speaks on-stage during the Google I/O keynote session at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, on May 10, 2023.

The search product could be disruptive. It generates a coherent capsule answer of several paragraphs or a bullet-pointed list in response to most search queries. On desktop, it also displays three highly-relevant search results to the right of the capsule summary and includes standard web search results below the A.I.-generated summary. But journalists who have gotten access so far point out, on mobile devices, the capsule summary actually takes up the entire first screen. And, if the summary is good enough, many users may never bother clicking on any of the links (or even see them), potentially depriving those sites of any search traffic. This would be a nightmare for publishers and many other businesses. Elizabeth Reid, the vice president of engineering for Search, who demoed SGE for me, tried to allay such fears. âWe want to ensure that we have a high value exchange with the ecosystem,â she said, using a term the Google Search team uses to refer to all those who generate information that Google then seeks organize through Search. âThis has been something Search has always been focused on.â

Reid did not say, however, exactly how Google will ensure that those companies that create high-quality information will continue to be compensated for that effort. She said Google would continue to âdo much experimentationâ over the right number and kind of links to highlight. She also said that for searches that are likely to be for a product purchase, SGE uses generative A.I. to create a âbuying guidesâ on the fly, in real-time, highlighting information from product descriptions that are relevant to a userâs search. The buying guide highlighted about five different âwaterproof portable speakers for under $100â in the demo Reid showed me.

Remember, right now this new search tool is essentially performing in the Google equivalent of off-off-Broadway. For instance, one issue with the generative A.I. responses is that they take a lot longer to load than the results of standard Google search wouldâand that is with relatively little demand for the service given that it was basically only available inside Google when Reid demoed it for me. How long would each response take if all 3.5 billion search queries that Google handles daily were run through SGE? âPart of the technology fun is working on the latency,â Reid said sardonically during our demo as we waited for a response to load. To make a significant strategic difference in the companyâs future, Google is going to have to bring generative A.I. to the main search bar. But itâs far from clear how quickly it will do so.

For now though, defense may be Googleâs best offense. Why risk 80% of your revenues if you donât have to? The company still has a 90% global marketshare in internet search. And while there are indications that Microsoftâs Bing has gained some converts with Bing Chat, there are no signs of a mass defection so far. In this environment, just matching competitorâs product features might be enough to ensure Google maintains its market dominance. (And in some areas, such as photo editing tools and mapping, Google offered some A.I. innovations at I/O that do seem to put it ahead of the competition. Meanwhile, an experimental product called Project Tailwind looked like it could really help anyone researching a major project, be it a book or film or a business intelligence or Wall Street analysts report.)

There is also hope that Googleâs A.I. offerings will win it more cloud computing customers. âThe call of the hour for Google, is to inspire enterprises and developers to recognize and reimagine their A.I. and cloud initiatives with Googleâs broad portfolio,â Chirag Dekate, A.I. infrastructure and supercomputing analyst at technology research firm Gartner, said. âIf Google succeeds in this mission, they will be successful in meaningfully changing cloud market shares.â Dekate added that âGoogle has the tools to dominate the AI battles, the perineal question is: Will they?â

Wall Street certainly liked what it saw yesterday. Googleâs parent Alphabet has seen its stock price climb 8% over the past two days. The longer-term picture though remains unclear. For instance, the new Search experience is powered by Palm 2 and another A.I. model that Google has already used to help with search, called MUM, as well as its traditional knowledge graph search algorithm. But Pichai teased an even more powerful multi-modal generative A.I. foundation model that Google has in the works, called Gemini, several times in his keynote. From what little Pichai said about Gemini, it sounds like it could be transformativeâtrained not just to be multi-modal, but also to take actions. But giving generative A.I. agency is also potentially dangerous. And while there are a number of startups already working on these kinds of generative A.I. assistants and a lot of developers even building systems that can create their own sub-goals and try to execute them, it isnât entirely clear how Google will square the concept of generative A.I. agents with its âbold and responsibleâ mantra.

459,2023-05-16T16:06:55+00:00,"Google is firing back at Microsoft, and investors seem to be loving it","Google (GOOG, GOOGL) came out swinging a sledgehammer of AI aimed directly at rival Microsoft (MSFT) during its big I/O developer conference this week. Months after Microsoft unveiled its Bing chatbot and search engine experience, Google fired back with its own AI-powered search platform, while also making Bard available to all users.

The moves are meant to prove that Google, which helped pioneer the technology behind Microsoft partner OpenAIâs ChatGPT, can match and exceed the Windows makerâs offerings in the nascent generative AI space.

And Wall Street seems to be taking note. Shares of Googleâs parent Alphabet were up more than 5% in afternoon trading. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, were roughly flat.

Microsoft has been leading the AI conversation since it debuted its Bing chatbot in February. Google tried to preempt Microsoftâs announcement by revealing Bard a day before Microsoft showed off Bing to the press. But without a live demonstration, Google quickly found itself playing catch up.

New products

But on Wednesday, the company debuted a variety of new products meant to brush aside Microsoftâs threat to Googleâs dominance.

The biggest announcement came by way of what Google calls its Search Generative Experience. The platform is a kind of reimagining of Google Search that uses generative AI to provide more expansive, conversational answers to your queries.

Type âGood bike for a 5-mile commute with hills,â and youâll receive a series of tips on what to look for when buying a bike for commuting, as well as a list of ads for bikes with explanations about each of them.

From there you can ask follow-up questions about e-bikes, and eventually end up with the bike you might want to buy. If it looks like a familiar experience, itâs because itâs a similar layout to Microsoftâs Bing search engine.

Googleâs Bard, meanwhile, is the companyâs answer to Microsoftâs Bing chat bot. Both provide conversational answers to your queries and can provide follow up responses. Bard is also getting whatâs called multimodal support, meaning youâll be able to get answers as both text and images. Microsoft is working on the same thing for Bing.

On the productivity front, Google announced a new Help Me Write feature for Gmail, which literally helps you write email responses to make getting through your inbox a little bit easier. Microsoftâs own Microsoft 365 productivity suite also offers generative AI features that help you put together things like cover letters in Word and presentations in PowerPoint.

Then there were Google's new generative AI features for Android phones. The company says it's Magic Compose, which will be available later this year, will let users change the style of their text in the Messages app. So if you ask someone to dinner, you can adjust the setting to ""Chill,"" ""Excited,"" or ""Lyrical"" and Magic Compose will alert your text to match.

Google also announced a new option for Android phones that will let you use generative AI to create new wallpapers. That feature is coming to Pixel devices next month.

Both companies are racing to become the leaders in generative AI at a point when the technology is still new to consumers. The boom in the area kicked off when OpenAI released its ChatGPT in November 2022. The platform quickly became one of the most popular apps on the internet, and sent companies into overdrive searching for a means to add similar features to their products.

For Google and Microsoft, the key is ensuring that generative AI helps drive user engagement that they can translate to advertising sales. But both companies need to tread carefully. Generative AI is prone to making up responses that sound shockingly true.

Those kinds of errors could impact user trust, hurting both the companies and any reason consumers have for using their products.

The race is on.

In a move to prioritize resources, Google Travel eliminated the feature that enabled Gmail users to view their past and upcoming trips, including everything from accommodations reservations to flights and things to do bookings, on google.com/travel.

This collection of travelersâ past and future trips, however, will still appear on Google Calendar.

âThis year, we said bon voyage to the trip summary feature on google.com/travel,â Google said in a statement. âTo keep you organized, travel reservations sent to your Gmail account will continue to appear on Google Calendar, as long as you have smart features and personalization turned on in your Gmail settings.â

The company intends to continue to focus on flights, hotels, vacation rentals, and experiences.

Google introduced the trip summary feature in 2019, and it was a mainstay of Google Travel, which today offers flights, things to do, hotels and vacation rentals. Google Travel visitors, if they were signed in to their Google accounts, for several months would have been able to see a notification that this itinerary aggregation feature would be discontinued. The end indeed came on May 1.

This was a nifty feature for some â if you didnât mind Google having access to all of your travel plans, and trust Google that they donât share the information. However, Google decided to eliminate the free feature in Google Travel because the number of people using it was too small to justify the resources needed to maintain or further develop it, according to a Google spokesperson.

In January, Google layed off 12,000 full-time employees, or around 6 percent of its workforce, but according to Google, these job cuts had nothing to do with the decision to scuttle the trip summary feature on Google Travel. Google made the decision to discontinue this itinerary collection feature in Google Travel sometime in 2022.

Google was able to collect travelers reservations by mining Gmail, which Google owns, for flight and hotel confirmations, for example. Google adds a module to confirmation emails in Gmail and until May 1 that module contained a link to your itinerary in Google Travel.

Story continues

You can view the Google Travel module in the accompanying image above a JetBlue confirmation email.

The module had a link, View in Travel, which took users to their itineraries in Google Travel.

It makes for a confusing user experience because you might want to check in for your flight, but if you clicked on the View in Travel link above your confirmation email youâd end up on Google instead of the airline website, for example.

Google continues to stack these modules above Gmail usersâ reservation confirmations from airlines, accommodationsâ providers, and tour vendors, although these modules no longer have the View in Travel link. Instead, for Gmail users who activate smart features and personalizations, their trips would appear in Google Calendar alone.

Google announced it would add video conferencing apps to its Android-based built-in car software at the Google I/O annual conference on Wednesday (May 11).

Dubbed Android Auto, Google says the software will be available in 200 million cars by the end of the year. Specifically, the update will add functionality for Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Webex by Cisco, allowing drivers to âjoin important meetings without taking your eyes off the road.â

âWhile we would all love to listen to music or catch up on our favorite podcast during our commute, sometimes traffic or work has other plans,â David Dandeneau, an engineering lead on the project, said when introducing the new functionality at the meeting. â[This feature allows you] to join a scheduled meeting without fumbling for your phone.â

It is just one of a slew of new features automakers have recently rolled out that are slowly turning cars into glorified computers. Google also announced that Android Auto users could now watch YouTube videos and play video games while parked.

The addition is part of a growing, post-pandemic expectation that employees will be able to work from anywhere and everywhere, apparently including moments when they are stuck in traffic. The different telework software applications will only be available in audio. Virtually no cars on the market feature a driver-facing camera.

Tesla already incorporated Zoom audio functionality into its in-car software last year, and Mercedes-Benz announced its âSuperscreenâ would feature Zoom and WebX functionality, as well as TikTok and Angry Birds.

Some safety advocates question the move, pointing to the increase in mileage death rates even throughout the pandemic when, relieved of their daily commutes, many drivers spent less time on the road.

Quotable: Everything is a computer these days

âWe really designed the Model S to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels. Tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company. A huge part of what Tesla is, is a Silicon Valley software company. We view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop.â

What To Expect At Google I/O 2023

If early reports are any indication, Google has plans to unveil PaLM 2, its most advanced large language model (LLM) to date.

Developed and operating under the codename Unified Language Model, it includes more than 100 languages and has the potential to tackle a variety of coding, math, and writing prompts.

If PaLM 2 sounds familiar, it's probably because you recall Google's update about Med-PaLM 2 earlier this year. As a medical large language model, Google has high hopes that it will bring generative AI in healthcare to the forefront. Below is an excerpt from its recent update.

""Med-PaLM 2 harnesses the power of Google's LLMs, aligned to the medical domain to more accurately and safely answer medical questions. As a result, Med-PaLM 2 was the first LLM to perform at an âexpert' test-taker level performance on the MedQA dataset of U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions, reaching 85%+ accuracy, and it was the first AI system to reach a passing score on the MedMCQA dataset comprising Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions, scoring 72.3%.""

Other points of interest that could be discussed at the conference include advancements to Bard and Search, the expansion of its Workspace AI collaborator and updates to its image recognition tool Google Lens.

While there's a lot of information to be presented at Google I/O 2023, expect to hear plenty from the company about its advancements in all areas of artificial intelligence.

The Rise of AI

ChatGPT and other AI and LLM models have taken over the tech scene. Hundreds of companies are flocking to implement features, and Microsofts $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent, OpenAI, has put substantial pressure on Google to perform and adapt. Other startups like AtomBeam have seen continued success in the retail startup investing market. The startup uses AI to compact data by up to 75% increasing bandwidth 4x.

The FTSE 100 and European stocks finished higher this Friday after data showed the UK economy returned to growth in the first quarter, while Wall Street's main stock indexes struggled for direction.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.28% to close at 7,752 points, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris climbed 0.29% to 7,403 points. In Germany, the DAX (^GDAXI) gained 0.47% to 15,909.

The UKâs blue chip index bounced back after data showed that the UK economy grew in the first three months of 2023.

Gross domestic product grew 0.1% in the first three months of 2023 despite a contraction in March, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The rise was in line with forecasts and came despite a fall of 0.3% in March.

Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said growth was ""eked out despite strike activity which derailed some momentum"".

""The data comes hot on the heels of changed forecasts from the Bank of England. Lower energy prices are expected to stop the UK economy from contracting compared to previous expectations,"" she added.

Or, read the transcript!

It was not a tech giant like Google or Apple that created ChatGPT. Rather, the AI bot came from a little-known 300-employee startup called OpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley elites with Elon Musk and Sam Altman as early board members.

OpenAIâs release of ChatGPT in November 2022 took the internet by storm with its ability to generate content ranging from haikus to short stories in human-sounding prose. Within two months of launch, ChatGPT had amassed millions of users.

To be sure, the AI bot has its flaws, from confidently giving the wrong answer to making stuff up. The so-called AI hallucinations pose a big challenge to the future of the AI industry.

Still, OpenAIâs release of ChatGPT has spurred companies from Google to Bain to say that theyâre incorporating generative AI into their services. Hereâs a look at how OpenAI skyrocketed to being the buzziest tech company of the moment.

It starts with a lofty goal Sam Altman.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

2015: OpenAI was launched as a nonprofit by a group of Silicon Valley titans including Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman. The group created a research lab focused on building software that could replicate human intelligence and capabilities, better known to AI researchers as âgeneral artificial intelligence.â Musk and others pledged $1 billion in donations, reported the New York Times.

The companyâs mission was to create AI tools that âbenefit all of humanity.â At first, the lab pledged to open source all of its research, as Musk and Altman said that the threat of harmful AI would be mitigated if everyone had access to the technology. But as the lab started building its AI tools, some OpenAI employees said that some of its ideas and code should be walled off from the public, according to The Times, arguing that openly sharing OpenAIâs software could exacerbate the generation and distribution of false information.

Musk says peace Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI.

2018: Musk resigned from OpenAIâs board, reportedly in part due to his growing conflict of interest with OpenAI. By then, Musk was building his own AI project at Tesla: Autopilot, the driver-assistance technology that automatically steers, accelerates, and brakes cars on highways. He even reportedly poached a key employee from OpenAI.

âThere is disagreement, mistrust, egos,â Mr. Altman said in an interview with the Times. âThe closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are. You see this in sects and religious orders. There are bitter fights between the closest people.â

OpenAI begins a relationship with Microsoft OpenAI is run on Microsoftâs cloud computing service.

2019: Microsoft announced it would invest $1 billion in OpenAI, allowing the company to train and run its AI models on Azure, Microsoftâs cloud computing service. The funding marked a major turning point for OpenAI.

That same year, OpenAI moved to a âcapped profitâ structure, which allowed it to build massive computing power and attract top talent, as the Wall Street Journal reported.

OpenAI releases a realistic-looking art generator ChatGPT.

2021: OpenAI introduced DALL-E, an AI system that creates images from text descriptions. The model would spur competitors like Midjourney and Stability AI.

ChatGPT goes through multiple iterations ChatGPT is a conversational bot.

2022: In early 2022, the team started building ChatGPT. When the chatbot was ready, OpenAI let beta users test the technology, but it wasnât clear to users what they were supposed to talk about with the bots, Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder and current president, told Fortune.

OpenAI switched gears and tried to build expert chatbots that could help professionals in specific areas, but that also didnât work out as planned. So, instead, the company decided to release ChatGPT to the public in its current form.

Type anything you wish.

Nov. 2022: On Nov. 30, ChatGPT launched to the world.

today we launched ChatGPT. try talking with it here: https://t.co/uWra8LKFMN

â Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2022

Within five days of its release, more than 1 million people had used ChatGPTâa milestone that took Facebook 10 months to hit, according to Fortune.

More companies go all in on generative AI Sam Altman talks about the new AI-powered Bing at a Microsoft event.

Jan. 2023: Microsoft rolled out the latest Bing search engine, powered by generative AI. A few weeks later, Google released Bard, the AI chatbot competitor. Big Techâs race to dominate AI was officially underway.

In the same month, OpenAI announced a partnership with Bain. The consultancy firm said it would incorporate âOpenAI technologies into its internal knowledge management system, research, and processes to improve efficiency.â The following month, Salesforce announced it would be integrating OpenAI technologies into Slack, which it owns, with the goal of helping users send and retrieve information faster.

A better, faster version of ChatGPT is released. ChatGPT.

ChatGPT released GPT-4 in March.

March 2023: On March 14, OpenAI released ChatGPT-4, a more accurate version of its previous chatbot. The company claimed that ChatGPT-4 was able to pass the bar exam with a score in the top 10% of test takers.

The newest model accepts images. On a livestream on March 14, OpenAIâs president, Greg Brockman, demonstrated by uploading into ChatGPT a photo of a handwritten note describing what he wants a website to look like. The tool generated code that he could use to build that exact site.

Regulators quickly turned their attention to generative AI companies. Italy temporarily banned ChatGPT over concerns of the processing of personal data for its model, making it the first Western country to take action against a chatbot.

OpenAI responds to privacy concerns Sam Altman.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

April 2023: A spokesperson for OpenAI, Hannah Wong, told the New York Times that the company generated profits for investors, but that it is still governed by a nonprofit and that its profits were capped.

On April 25, OpenAI announced that users can turn off ChatGPTâs chat history, which would also disable future training on the unsaved chats.

This surely wonât be the last update for OpenAI and the rest of the rapidly developing AI industry.

477,2023-05-15T22:36:37+00:00,Shareholders Would Enjoy A Repeat Of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Recent Growth In Returns,"If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) look very promising so lets take a look.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Alphabet is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) Ã· (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.24 = US$72b Ã· (US$369b - US$69b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).

Thus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 7.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.

Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce

In the above chart we have measured Alphabet's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Alphabet.

What Can We Tell From Alphabet's ROCE Trend?

Alphabet is displaying some positive trends. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 24%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 66%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Alphabet thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.

The Bottom Line

To sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.

479,2023-05-15T20:13:21+00:00,UPDATE 2-India starts inquiry into Google app payments antitrust compliance,"(Adds details from antitrust order)

By Aditya Kalra

NEW DELHI, May 12 (Reuters) - India's competition watchdog has begun an inquiry into Google after some companies alleged the service fee the U.S. firm charges for in-app payments breaches an earlier antitrust directive, a regulatory order seen by Reuters showed on Friday.

Tinder-owner Match Group and Indian startups have asked the watchdog to investigate Google's new User Choice Billing (UCB) system, which they alleged was anti-competitive.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday issued an order stating ""it is of the opinion that an inquiry needs to be made.""

The order is not public and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In October, the CCI imposed a $113 million fine on Google and said it must allow the use of third-party billing and stop forcing developers to use its in-app payment system that charges commission of 15%-30%.

Google later began offering UCB to allow alternative payments alongside Google's when purchasing in-app digital content, but some companies complained the new system still imposes a high ""service fee"" of 11%-26%.

This, Match and the Alliance of Digital India Foundation argued, meant Google had not complied with the earlier antitrust directive that ordered it not to impose any such ""unfair and disproportionate"" conditions.

In its order, the watchdog asked Google to explain certain provisions related to the in-app payment system before and after UCB and provide details of policies related to sharing of user and app developer data.

480,2023-05-15T19:45:00+00:00,Is Most-Watched Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Worth Betting on Now?,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Shares of this company have returned +8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet Inc. belongs, has gained 10.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating a change of +9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6%.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $60.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $248.34 billion and $274.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +10.7%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Alphabet Inc. reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +10.38%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Alphabet Inc. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $60.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $248.34 billion and $274.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +10.7%, respectively.

482,2023-05-15T17:53:24+00:00,Everyone is getting the AI 'revolution' wrong: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:

The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.

Two letters are on the tip of every business executive's tongue these days: AI.

And even with a seemingly endless discussion of artificial intelligence and its potential application across industries, the level of conversation happening about AI is not right.

Either we're talking about it way too much or way too little.

Today's middle ground on ""everyone has a strategy"" will either be a strange footnote for this business cycle or a gross underestimation of the technology's true power. There is no in between.

The AI boom that was catalyzed by OpenAI's ChatGPT early this year is at a fever pitch, with Google's annual I/O developer conference on Wednesday serving as the latest showcase for the nascent technology.

In a video posted to Twitter Wednesday afternoon, the folks over at The Verge succinctly summed up Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai's pitch to investors. A pitch that involved saying ""AI"" or ""generative AI"" more than two dozen times and has resulted in Alphabet stock popping more than 7% over the last two trading sessions.

Talking about AI at ""Sundar Pichai I/O presentation"" levels, it seems, is good by investors.

Pretty sure Google is focusing on AI at this yearâs I/O. #GoogleIOpic.twitter.com/RxlFQw2l8b

â The Verge (@verge) May 10, 2023

On his company's earnings call late Wednesday, Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger quipped that he's ""looking forward to a time [when] maybe AI does earnings calls for me."" Adding: ""You probably wouldn't know the difference.""

Story continues

But, of course, Iger's charming retort was followed by a serious answer.

Because no serious executive at this point doesn't have a response to questions about what a company's AI strategy might be.

""It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits,"" Iger added. ""In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours. And we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that.""

For companies like Disney with huge libraries of intellectual property that could potentially be spoofed by new technologies, Iger added, ""our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.""

Overall, Iger said he's ""bullish"" on the prospects for bringing AI into Disney's business.

Which, of course. The technical marvel of ""Fantasia"" has already been rendered routine by technological advances; AI might make a film like this from something you could sketch out by lunch.

Speaking with Yahoo Finance Live last week, Airbnb (ABNB) CEO Brian Chesky called AI a ""revolution,"" adding: ""[AI is] going to change everyone's life. It's going to be like electricity. It's going to be something that we're all going to live with. It's a little hard to predict.""

Neils Bohr once said that predictions are hard to make, especially those about the future.

But if we're indeed on the cusp of an electricity-level shift in our relationship with a certain technology then no one in business, the media, education, government, or any other institution should feel self-conscious about continually evangelizing on the power of AI. One day, that evangelism will merely be table stakes.

Should AI appear more like the recent hype about ""blockchain technology"" that fizzled with the 2018-19 crypto winter, however, then today's AI discourse will be remembered largely for what it's been so far â a little annoying, a little insistent, and a bit too pat to seem like the real thing.

483,2023-05-15T17:18:02+00:00,Google Workspace VP: 'Losing the trust of the user is the ultimate point of no return',"Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Wednesday rolled out a slew of new generative AI features for its vast ecosystem of products as part of its I/O conference. The event was equal parts a means for the company to show off what itâs been working on for the past year and proving to its users, and investors, that it, not Microsoft (MSFT), is the AI leader.

One of the major announcements during the show included the addition of a generative AI feature called Help Me Write, which will, well, help you write emails. But because it uses generative AI, Google Workspace VP Aparna Pappu says the company needs to take care that it doesnât push out inappropriate responses or the company risks losing usersâ trust.

âLosing the trust of the user is the ultimate point of no return,â she told Yahoo Finance. âThat's our Northstar, âCannot lose user trust.â â

Generative AI has raised a slew of thorny questions ranging from whether it will make jobs, like yours trulyâs, obsolete to whether it should be allowed in schools. How much users can trust the technology to produce accurate responses to their prompts has also become a point of contention. Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks on-stage during the Google I/O keynote session at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, on May 10, 2023. (Photo by Josh Edelson / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)

Pappu says thatâs also part of the reason Google is only rolling out its generative AI features to trusted testers before going public.

âBefore we get into [general availability] we have you got to test it and put it through the wringer even to get it to Labs [Googleâs early user test program] it goes through so much rigorous usage testing, and responsibility testing, safety testing before we even let a single external user try it,â Pappu explained.

Both Google and Microsoftâs generative AI offerings specifically state that theyâre in early testing phases or that some answers may not be accurate. Moreover, generative AI in general is prone to âhallucinate,â which is basically an elaborate way of saying it can make up responses to some user queries that seem accurate, but are wrong.

During a â60 Minutesâ segment Googleâs Bard chatbot hallucinated a book that doesnât exist. CEO Sundar Pichai explained during the segment that the problem is one that many chatbots have at this point and something engineers are trying to better understand.

Story continues

To that end, Pappu says Google continues to test its systems as a means of trying to prevent false answers or inappropriate responses. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

âResponsible and safe AI, it does not get born overnight. It is years of working on AI and knowing how to do adversarial testing,â Pappu explained. âSo there's fundamentally responsible, safe AI baked into how we build these products.â

One problem that Pappu says is unique to Workspace is that itâs used by billions of users, each with their own understanding of technology. Introducing a feature like generative AI to the equation without confusing those users is a conundrum all its own.

âWe have 3 billion users,â she said. âWe have a responsibility to make these things really simple and easy to use.â

485,2023-05-15T15:59:01+00:00,S&amp;P 500 set for another weekly loss as tech drops on plunge in consumer sentiment,"Investing.com -- The S&P 500 stumbled Friday, staying on course for another weekly loss as rising yields blunted tech stocks and a plunge in consumer sentiment to six-month lows triggered a bout of caution on Wall Street.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, or 154 points lower, and the Nasdaq slid 0.8%

The melt-up in tech stocks ran out of steam as Treasury yields regained momentum after Federal Reserve officials suggested that further rate hikes canât be ruled out as inflation remains too high and labor markets too tight.

""Should inflation remain high and the labor market remain tight, additional monetary policy tightening will likely be appropriate,â Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said on Friday.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the move lower in big tech followed by Meta and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), though Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bucked the trend to trade flat after the tech giant agreed to pay $8 million to settle allegations of misleading advertising to promote its Pixel 4 smartphone.

Data showing consumer sentiment fell by more than expected to 63.5 in April, the lowest reading since last November, and long-term consumer inflation rising to a 12-year high also weighed on sentiment.

Consumer stocks including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) were among the worst hit.

The struggles in regional banks continued to weigh on the broader market, with PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW) dropping 3% after announcing it had pledged more collateral to the Fed to allow it to borrow an additional $3.9 billion from the central bankâs emergency lending facilities.

The regional banking crisis will likely deteriorate further as many banks have exposure to low-yielding assets at a time when the higher interest rates are forcing them to offer more attractive rates of return, pushing up their funding costs and pressuring margins.

Story continues

The banking turmoil is something that âprobably gets worse, meaning people are going to be less interested in lending money, three months from now even than they are today,â Chief Strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management Rhys Williams told Investing.com's Yasin Ebrahim in an interview on Thursday.

âI think it's a significant issue for the economy and supportive of GDP slowing,â Williams added.

In deal news, First Solar Inc (NASDAQ:FSLR) jumped 25% after the solar company announced a deal to acquire Evolar AB for up to $80M to accelerate its development of photovoltaic technology.

On the political front, there were some hopes of progress on talks in Washington among lawmakers on legislation to raise the debt ceiling and avoid the U.S. default on its debt payments.

U.S. credit-default swaps, an insurance against bad loans, on Treasuries have been on the rise in recent days, suggesting that worries about a default are growing.

The chance of a U.S. debt default is about 2%, according to Williams, though he adds that markets could sell off as the risk of a no-deal on raising the debt ceiling grows, but any losses would be recovered quickly as soon as a deal is announced.

âWe could easily have a five or 10% downdraft in stocks ahead of a deal, but we'll get it right back as soon as the deal is announced,â Williams said, adding that a 60/40 stock-to-bond portfolio allocation would help cushion the risk of a default.

""If there is a debt default, government bonds are going to go up because that's very economy negative and bank stocks are going to lose money and bonds are gonna make money,â he added.

492,2023-05-15T12:45:00+00:00,AI Comes To Meta's Rescue,"Meta Platforms (NASDSAQ: META) is still very much devoted to developing a virtual reality, with its latest quarterly earnings report showing it is not giving up on the metaverse it decided to build its future on. By the looks of it, AI is exactly what Meta needed to somehwat ease its investors' concerns.

The Unveiling Of AI testing Playground

On Thursday, Meta revealed the AI Sandbox that will help advertisers build campaigns and improve their results, as well as an updated Meta Advantage portfolio of automated tools that advertisers can use to enhance their campaigns. These efforts areÂ aimed at helping advertisers both save time and improve theÂ results of their efforts. They are alsoÂ Metaâs latest effort to show investors that costly AI efforts justify their hefty costs.

Outlook That Reflects The Weight Of AI Efforts

During the companyâs latest earnings call, CFO Susan Li guided for the full year capital expenditure to be in the range between $30 billion and $33 billion as Meta continues to build its AI capacity.

Positive Results Showed AÂ Strong Quarter

For its first quarter, Meta succeeded to beat analyst expectations as it posted YoY revenue growth for the first time in three quarters.

Following Through Is Not An Easy Task

Concerns are growing that the metaverse efforts are draining valuable resources that exceed $10 billion a year, without any tangible benefits on the horizon. But by changing the company name to the name of the product, backing out stopped being an option so Meta can only follow through what Zuckerberg envisioned and that is not only to create the metaverse, but for the company to alsoÂ become a leader in AI research along the way, facing off Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).

Microsoft Is Leading The Way To AÂ New AI Era

Microsoft has its eyes set on not only winning the AI wars but also on obtaining the search engine crown. Just a few months ago, Microsoft unveiled its co-pilot for web search, the AI-powered Bing and Edge. During its latest earnings call, the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, promised to reinvent the future of online search, the largest category of software in the world. Despite the company's long-standing partnership with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft even went further by joining forces with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) to develop AI semiconductor chips that could challenge Nvidiaâs dominance.

Googleâs Response

Alphabet, whose Google is known as the âsearch kingâ has added AI in its core product attempt to create some kind of excitement that Microsoft received when it integrated its AI-powered chatbot to Bing. During Googleâs annual conference that took place on Wednesday, Alphabet revealed a revamped version of its search engine named the Search Generative Experience. With this move, Alphabet can offer crafted responses to open-ended queries while keeping its recognizable links to the Web, with the search king clearly showing that Google will respond to Microsoftâs AI challenge.

Despite AÂ Strong Quarter, Meta Is Facing Tough Times

In order to reach Zuckerbergâs desired destination without the scenario of staying the metaverse course on a sinking ship, the weakening online ad market made it obvious that Meta will need more revenue sources for its journey. Young users are fleeing the platform and legislation is working to put a stop on its revenue model based on vacuuming up and selling the gathered user data. In its past life as Facebook, the company faced severe criticism in this regard. Unlike Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) who remained loyal to its inspirational identity, Facebookâs moral grounds were questioned as it failed to take action in stopping hate speech, not to mention the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Social media has received so much backlash from all sides, and Pinterest is one of those rare platforms that succeeded to stay out of it. Although PinterestÂ is paying the price in terms ofÂ lagging in terms of monetization and profitability, its CEO is willing to pay the costs ofÂ creating an algorithm and consequently, a business model, that is built around the concept of making people feel better, as opposed to the current one that thrives on endorsing theÂ bad sides of the human nature. Moral and ethics areÂ not the kind of concept that Metaâs CEO was ever linked to. Although Pinterest still needs to prove that business can be done in a way that makes the world a better place, the platform didÂ receiveÂ the multiannualÂ support fromÂ Amazon who is more than capable to help it make that part of the equation happen, while Metaâs supporters are getting increasingly concerned.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Even Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who has been bullish about what the âprofoundâ technology means for the future, believes that it will send shockwaves through the working world.

âI think itâll touch everything we do,â Pichai said of A.I. in an interview with The Vergeâs Nilay Patel published Friday. âI do think there are big societal labor market disruptions that will happen.â

But the tech chief thinks that A.I. could also make some jobs better, if itâs done right. He used the example of the legal profession, which some believe will be the most disrupted by A.I., and said that even with technological developments, the need for some skills and services will not be eliminated altogether.

âSo, A.I. will make the profession better in certain ways, might have some unintended consequences, but Iâm willing to almost bet 10 years from now, maybe there are more lawyers.â

While A.I.-powered products are still in their early stages, companies are already rolling out tools for businesses to use the technology. Meta, besides pouring money into their own A.I. products, also recently announced an A.I. feature for its advertisers to use. And major law firms are already using A.I. to draft documents and look over contracts.

Google did not immediately respond to Fortuneâs request for further comment.

The 'platform shift'

Pichai says that an A.I. âplatform shiftâ is underway, and compared job anxieties now to those that went along with the dawn of the personal computer, the internet and mobile phones.

Story continues

âTwenty years ago, when people exactly predicted what tech automation would do, there were very specific pronouncements of entire job categories which would go away. That hasnât fully played out,â Pichai said.

Pichai isnât the only tech CEO who thinks A.I. will have a major impact on the labor force. IBMâs CEO Arvind Krishna said earlier this week that A.I. could do â30% to 50%â of the repetitive office work. He added that if machines can do those tasks, it âfrees up employees to take on higher-value work.â In his own company, Krishna said they were beginning to automate key tasks, and have been able to shift from 700 people doing HR-related manual tasks, to just 50.

And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has previously told Fortune that todayâs workforce should be prepared to work âhand in hand with A.I.âÂ  He added in a statement this week that A.I. could unlock potential on a large scale.

âThis new generation of AI will remove the drudgery of work and unleash creativity,â Nadella said. âThereâs an enormous opportunity for AI-powered tools to help alleviate digital debt, build AI aptitude, and empower employees.â

But not everyone is as optimistic about how A.I. could change the job landscape. Geoffrey Hinton, an award-winning A.I. pioneer and a former engineering fellow at Google, said he was concerned about some of the more mundane jobs being replaced by A.I.

âIt takes away the drudge work,â Hinton told the New York Times. âIt might take away more than that.â

Other experts say thereâs also the concern about using A.I. to generate opportunities rather than destroy them.

âI think thereâs a risk that ChatGPT makes us a lot more productive in easy-to-do stuff, but the hard part to figure out is how we can use A.I. to create innovation that then creates new occupations and new industries,â Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist who predicted automation would wipe out 47% of U.S. jobs 10 years ago, told Fortune in February.

497,2023-05-15T09:00:00+00:00,"Google, Meta and other tech companies are cutting back on a prized Silicon Valley tradition: summer internships","School is out for the summer, and college students who duked it out for prized internships at the world's largest tech companies will soon walk through the lobbies of their temporary corporate homes.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

The summer internship is one of Silicon Valley's most celebrated traditions, a 3-month whirlwind of long workdays, quirky team-building activities and first-hand immersion into the customs, culture and perks of tech life. But with the tech industry in retrenchment mode, and tech workers getting laid off by the thousands, this year's intern season is kicking off with a pall hanging over it.

After years of scaling up internship programs to ever larger class sizes, and attracting high-performing students with competitive pay sometimes exceeding $6,400 a month, some of the largest tech companies are slashing their intern class sizes this summer.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is bringing on fewer interns this summer than in previous years, according to a company spokesperson. While the internship program was once such a treasured PR showpiece that Google even collaborated in the production of a 2013 Hollywood comedy about its summer interns, the company is now focused on cutting costs, having laid off roughly 12,000 employees in January. The Alphabet spokesperson would not provide details on the size of this year's intern class, though the company had more than 3,500 interns in 2021.

Meta, which in January withdrew year-long internship offers in the UK, declined to share the size of its intern classes, but said it is bringing on fewer interns this summer than last year, in line with its previously announced plans to decrease the global workforce. Ditto for Nvidiaâthe graphics chipmaker, which hired more than 1,500 interns in 2022, will hire approximately 600 interns this summer, a spokesperson told Fortune.

Story continues

The shrinking intern classes is one more reminder of the changing conditions within tech companies, long renown for their generous perks and amenities such as on-site restaurants and free laundry. And the restraint is reverberating on college campuses, where internships at Big Tech have traditionally been the most popular and competitive summer gigs.

âThis year has been difficult for both the employers and our students. We are in a period of flux,â said Ruth A. Franks, the director of career services at the University of Texas at Austin.

""It is safe to say that if a student is dead set on getting an internship at a âBig Techâ company like Meta or Amazon, the process will be more stressful and likely disappointing than in the past,"" Franks said, but added that many students are discovering internship opportunities outside of Big Tech that are equally rewarding.

Those who did manage to get offers in tech are still holding their breath. Amira Sounny-Slitine, a career coach at the University of Texas, has noticed an increase in students being worried that their offers will be rescinded as more tech layoffs continue. Sheâs noticed that even when students are excited about landing an internship, theyâve asked if they should keep an eye out for backups and donât want to let their guard down before their internship officially starts.

Of the ten large cap tech companies that Fortune reached out to, none said they were increasing the size of their summer internship classes this year. Microsoft, which had more than 4,000 interns in 2020, would not comment on the size or this year's intern program, nor would Netflix or Intel. Apple did not return repeated requests for comment.

Amazon will reportedly see a lower class size after hiring about 18,000 interns last year, some of whom were paid nearly $30,000 for the summer. For this year, the company is considering reducing the number of interns for 2023 by more than half, the New York Times reported in December, citing an anonymous person with knowledge of the program. Asked about the accuracy of the report, Amazon said, ""We remain committed to our internship program and to fostering the next generation of talent through the real-world experience our program provides.""

Uber said it expects this yearâs internship program to be the same size as last year, which was one of the largest cohortsâbut declined to provide specific numbers. Salesforce said its number of summer interns typically ranges between 700 and 1,300 and that it expected this year's class to fall within that range.

""Despite the challenges the tech industry has faced this year, we remain committed to our Futureforce internship program and nurturing the next generation of tech talent,"" Alex Murray, head of Global Futureforce Programs at Salesforce, told Fortune in an emailed statement.

The intern classes are smaller, but interns are back in the office

Internships have served an important role at tech companies, providing a pipeline to develop new talentâJen Fitzpatrick, a Senior VP at Google was part of its first, four-person intern class in 1999âand to bring much-needed diversity to the ranks. In 2019, for example, Google-parent company Alphabet said that 24% of the interns in the U.S. that summer identified as Black+ or Latinx+, up from 20% the prior year.

""Our internship program is one way weâre working to build a workforce thatâs more representative of the people we serve, in addition to developing programs toÂ retain and growÂ diverse talent and improve representationÂ at the leadership level,"" Google said in a blog post at the time. This year's smaller intern class sizes risks impeding that progress, some observers worry.

For students who land a coveted internship, the experience can feel like winning the lottery. Videos of soon-to-be interns unboxing packages of company swag, like propeller hats from Google, regularly circulate on social media every spring as college semesters wind down. As the summer progresses, videos like this one by a Spotify intern in New York, provide first-person office tours marveling at the company arcade featuring Pac-Man, Mario Kart, and a Dance Dance Revolution-like game. At Microsoft, interns once created a musical.

Some of that energy and excitement was lost during the pandemic's shift to remote work, and so, while companies may not be increasing the sizes of their programs this summer, they're looking at the bright side and touting the return to in-person internships. ""Students are excited to be back in person,"" says Uberâs Director of Global University Recruiting & Programs, Dawn Carter, noting that interns will still have the flexibility of a hybrid work schedule and that satisfaction scores during remote internships in recent years remained strong.

At Salesforce, interns will report to the office and be assigned to ""intern-specific floors and spaces, where theyâll get hands-on experience, and theyâll connect with their global cohort through virtual events,"" the company says. One of those events will be the company's first-ever product summit that will feature Salesforce customers, Futureforce alumni speakers, and interactive workshops.

Interns at Nvidia meanwhile, will have an opportunity to spend time with CEO Jensen Huang, according to the company.

Unlike the hijinks and horseplay that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson got up to at Google in the 2013 comedy The Internship, the tasks that real life interns perform are serious and can involve working on critical parts or the business, the tech companies stress.

âOur internships are designed to provide students with a sense of what itâs really like to work at Amazon, and they get to do meaningful work, diving into products, programs, and services that affect millions of customers,â Amazon director of recruiting and student programs Keyon Young says.Â Interns are given a manager, a mentor, and an onboarding buddy who can answer questions about company policies and whoâs who within Amazon.

Lindsey Duran, VP of Recruiting for Nvidia, says that the internship program is geared at providing formal events like games on site or volunteering, but that the group eventually bonds and connects on their own.

âWhat you find is that the interns themselves, as they start to build their networks and their relationships, they start to build their own community and some of those social events,â Duran said. Compensation for this year's Nvidia interns âincreased slightly to remain consistent with the market.â

For many interns, the prize at the finish line is the prospect of receiving a full time job offer. At Intel, 60% of summer interns have historically gone on to accept full time jobs at the chip company after graduation, according to the company.

But the odds of the promised payoff may be getting worse as tech companies cut back on hiring, delay start dates, and in some cases, even rescind job offers, as Google did with thousands of temporary and contract workers in 2020.

Andrea Comsa, the director of undergraduate co-op and internship programs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says she hasn't noticed a ""concerning decrease"" in tech internships. What worries her, however, are the graduating students, many of whom are seeing the start dates pushed back for their full time job offers.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on this past week's most momentous tech headlines: Alphabet's Google gets in the AI game; PayPal, Airbnb, and Twilio issue disappointing forecasts; and Zscaler has good news for investors.

InvestingPro subscribers got these headlines in real time, giving them a chance to rapidly readjust their portfolios. See for yourself by starting a 7-day free trial.

Alphabet takes the AI gloves off

Artificial intelligence capabilities are being integrated into Google search, Gmail, and Google Photos, said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) this past week at its annual I/O conference. The announcement comes in the aftermath of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) headline-making venture into AI with that company's $10 billion investment in ChatGPT and its integration into the tech giant's Bing search product.

The new Google search product, dubbed Search Generative Experience, would be able to verbally answer search queries alongside producing relevant links, and will be available via waitlist for U.S. customers over the coming weeks.

Analysts were positive on the prospects for Alphabet here. Goldman Sachs said that it is

...increasingly constructive on Alphabet's long-term strategic positioning in a number of key end markets and continue to see the company as the leading collection of AI/machine learning-driven businesses in our coverage universe.

Jefferies wrote, regarding Alphabet's generative AI strategy: ""We see momentum accelerating, and monetization before year-end."" And Evercore ISI said Google has taken the AI gloves off and ""reminded everyone of how long it has been investing in, developing, and deploying AI capabilities across all of its offerings.""

Alphabet shares gained 4% during the Wednesday session, when the conference took place, and were up nearly 12% for the week.

PayPal slides as analyst says it 'may be stuck'

PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) raised its full-year profit guidance, and first-quarter results topped expectations, but shares slumped on a lowered operating-margin outlook - from +125bps to +100bps - for the full year.

Story continues

Q1 earnings were $1.17 per share, better than the $1.10 average expectation, driven by cost cuts and an increase in new accounts. And sales of $7.04B edged past the consensus.

Looking ahead, the company now expects to grow adjusted EPS by about 20% to $4.95 - up from prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87.

Still, at least three analysts downgraded the stock, as InvestingPro subscribers found out first: Credit Suisse to Neutral from Outperform; Edward Jones to Hold from Buy, and Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) to Neutral from Outperform.

Credit Suisse said in a note:

Given the prospects for continued transaction margin pressures throughout 2023 (partly mix driven), PayPalâs vertical skew (discretionary) in an uncertain macro backdrop, a pending management transition, and increasing competitive pressures (longer term), we find it challenging to recommend the shares at this time.

And Oppenheimer believes PayPal stock ""may be stuck"" in the near term.

PayPal shares crashed more than 18% for the week.

Airbnb warns of slowing growth

Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) said it made $0.18 a share - a swing from last year's loss but also $0.02 shy of Street expectations - on in-line revenue of $1.8B. The company also announced a new share buyback program of up to $2.5B.

Looking ahead to Q2, the company guided revenue in a range of $2.35B to $2.45B, in line with Wall Street estimates, but also said Night and Experiences Booked ""will have unfavorable year-over-year comparisons in Q2 2023 as we overlap pent-up 2022 demand following the COVID Omicron variant.""

After that, the shares took a quick fall. Morgan Stanley cut the price target to $95 per share and reiterated an Underweight rating on ABNB stock, as InvestingPro reported in real time:

Slower-than-expected forward room night growth (US facing pricing and supply constraints) speak to how forward growth (more reliant on Europe, APAC, LATAM and new business opportunities) could face higher execution risk. Competitive risk (share loss to BKNG) also continues.

Oppenheimer believes that the velocity of 2Q23 nights deceleration will heighten concerns about slowing growth:

We maintain Perform on uncertain back-half outlook and premium valuation, 21x '23E EBITDA vs. BKNG's 15x, limiting NT upside to shares.

Shares tumbled more than 14% for the week.

Twilio slides on deflated outlook

Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) offered a soft Q2 revenue outlook, saying it expects EPS in the range of $0.27-$0.31, compared with the Wall Street consensus of $0.29. Revenue is seen at $980 million to $990M, missing the consensus estimate of $1.05B.

Q1 EPS of $0.47 and revenue of $1.01 billion came in better than anticipated, but Q2 guidance disappointed investors.

For the full year, the company expects non-GAAP income from operations in the range of $275M-$350M.

Oppenheimer cut the stock's price target to $75, citing continued headwinds for Twilio. However, the analyst remains Buy-rated, saying, ""the risk/reward is positively skewed.""

Bernstein also cut the stock's price target, going to $58:

At this point we remain on the sidelines while waiting for more clarity on the rebound and future.

Shares lost more than 14% for the week to $45.83.

Zscaler

Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) shares surged more than 20% Monday after the company's preliminary Q3 results beat expectations: Its top line should be between $415M and $419M, well above the previous guidance range of $396 million to $398 million.

In addition, the company's adjusted income from operations is far higher, now estimated to range between $60M and $64M.

CEO Jay Chaudhry said the company ""had a strong finish to the quarter"" thanks to high ROI from its Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform.

The cloud security company also now expects full-year revenue to range between $1.587B and $1.591B, above the previously forecast range of $1.558 billion to $1.563 billion.

On the heels of that news, CFRA upped the stock to Strong Buy from Buy. Zscaler earnings are expected June 1.

Shares were up 6.5% for the week.

Midjourney and Shutterstock are among the publishers Google has on board, and the goal is to ensure that all AI content that appears in search results is flagged as such.

The provenance of images online is a growing issue in the AI age, and there are several startups working to produce verification and authentication tools. Microsoft-backed Truepic Inc., for example, offers systems that ensure an image hasnât been manipulated from capture to delivery. Googleâs new features, which are rolling out over the course of this year, are comparatively lower-tech, though they may have a bigger positive impact with sufficient industry support.

In office blocks in cities across Africa, tens of thousands of workers scroll away, checking countless images, reading transcripts and watching videos.

This little known tech army, in hubs such as Accra in Ghana and Nairobi in Kenya, represent the brain power that has helped create the uncannily human responses of artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT.

Thousands of jobs have been created across the continent as data labellers â digital labourers who spend hours checking whether an AI bot has correctly identified whether an image of a dog is a dog, and not in fact a cat.

They read millions of pages of digitally transcribed text for accuracy, listen to voice assistant recordings and double check security camera alerts, correcting errors and perfecting responses.

According to the Economist, one such Chinese data labelling company employed 300,000 people, carefully annotating a syllabus from which AI algorithms can learn.

Data labelling jobs are fast becoming part of a new economy of machine learning work across the world. By some estimates it is already a multibillion dollar component of the AI industry.

But at the same time, there are fears millions of roles could be made redundant by these machines. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that 300 million jobs could soon be done by robots thanks to the new wave of AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images

Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, the Silicon Valley company behind ChatGPT, warned last week: âCustomer service is one category where I expect a lot of these jobs, honestly, to just go away.â

While fears that robots could replace millions of jobs have long been the stuff of science fiction, tech bosses are increasingly betting that the latest generation of AI algorithms will make this a reality.

Arvind Krishna, chief executive of IBM, went furthest earlier this month, stating that up to 30pc of back-office jobs, such as human resources, could be done by AI. He said IBM would stop hiring for roles that could be done by a machine instead, affecting up to 7,800 positions.

Adoption of these tools by businesses has accelerated as the popularity of ChatGPT surged and millions of internet users tried out the digitally intelligent chatbot and experimented with it to speed up their work.

ChatGPT, and AI models like it, can provide seemingly human responses to questions in plain English. The bot can be asked to write natural-sounding emails, articles and even essays, or converse with users Q&A style.

OpenAIâs technology has been trained on a vast database of text and books to provide realistically human answers. But behind the scenes, it has been tuned and tweaked by human handlers.

Other AI tools have been developed that make use of computer vision - machines that can âseeâ the world around them - essential for driverless cars or autonomous robots. Again, human beings have helped coach these algorithms by labelling images and correcting errors, known as âhuman reinforcement learningâ. Sama, an AI company that pioneered this work, at one point called these workers the âsoul of AIâ.

Even those who work in the machine learning space canât deny that this work can be monotonous. Andreas Heindl, a machine learning product manager at computer vision company Encord, admits data labelling work can be âvery tedious and time consumingâ¦ your arms and fingers started to hurt after one hour.â

But proponents of the new wave of AI tools insist that innovations like ChatGPT will free up people to do more interesting jobs.

Tech giants Microsoft and Google have added a suite of AI-powered tools to their workplace products.

On Wednesday, Google displayed how Bard, its new AI robot, could be used to write up job listings from a simple one line prompt. Microsoft has demonstrated how a ChatGPT-powered tool can write entire articles in Word.

âThere are a tonne of sales representatives doing a lot of banal work to compose prospecting emails,â says Rob Seaman, a senior vice president at workplace messaging company Slack, which is working with OpenAI to embed ChatGPT into its app as a kind of digital co-worker.

New AI tools may remove some of the most tedious aspects of such roles. But based on past evidence, technology also threatens to create a whole new class of menial roles.

Take the rise of social media. To keep up with the massive growth of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, tech giants were forced to outsource hundreds of thousands of jobs to content moderators whose job it is to sift through the worst images of abuse, violence and terror to keep our feeds clean.

Data labelling, meanwhile, has created jobs for tens of thousands of people, largely in low income countries. âIt is no surprise this is much more economically viable where salaries are lower,â says James Neave, a head of data science at jobs website Adzuna.

But at times, such work can sound like something out of dystopian Netflix series Black Mirror. Last year, MIT Review reported that Venezuelan data labellers for vacuum company iRobot had taken to sharing images collected from customers bots online - including images of people on the toilet. A spokesman said at the time it had terminated its deal with the labelling company.

There are, of course, many extremely well paid technical roles emerging from the rise of AI.

As well as much-in-demand AI coders and data scientists, the emerging role of âprompt engineerâ has seen salaries advertised of up to $335,000 on offer from Anthropic, an AI company backed by Google.

A prompt engineer is someone trained in the art of instructing AI, coaching it to provide the right answers for the task at hand. Using normal language, the prompt engineer assigns tasks to an AI such as ChatGPT, subtly altering the input to achieve different results.

But other roles face being rapidly augmented by powerful artificial intelligence bots.

Customer service jobs may be most at risk as chatbots take over. Those who are not replaced by automation may find themselves augmented with technology. In some cases, companies have taken to altering the accents of workers with AI software, making it sound like someone is from the United States, rather than outsourced overseas.

Paul Flemming, general secretary of the actors union Equity, told MPs last week that voice actors were being replaced by machines for radio adverts. âThe impact is on job and labour displacement,â he said. âThat opportunity to earn is being reduced.â

Journalists are already fearing the worst. CNET, the tech news site, quietly used automation technology to publish dozens of articles about credit cards and payments, although later paused the programme. BuzzFeed has said it will use ChatGPT to create quizzes.

In the UK, local publisher Newsquest has been seeking an âAI-powered reporterâ who will use automation tech to âcreate national, local and hyper-local content for our news brandsâ.

Neave, of Adzuna, says there are a number of jobs that are going to be âgradually replacedâ. Administrative jobs and legal legwork could be taken up by robots.

Tech giants have also turned their robots to mastering the art of coding. The bots are able to write code - with varying degrees of accuracy. Google held up coding as a key advantage of its new Bard chatbot last week.

Neave believes they are unlikely to replace engineers outright - in part due to the huge demand for such skills. But the bots are able to act âalmost like assistant coders that work with you"".

âIt will basically up the expectations that employers have for productivity.â

The current wave of AI tools also often make glaring errors and have little way of telling fact from fiction. Even if AI can speed up a job, a human is needed to check its working.

There are efforts to further streamline some of the most repetitive tasks that developing AI tools has led to. Encord, for example, is developing software that can take a much smaller set of labelled data and expand it to millions of pieces of information, reducing the need for hours of human labour.

âLabelling everything by hand is not feasible any more,â says Encordâs Heindl.

But with an explosion in demand for new and ever more magical AI machines, the need for an army of human handlers continues to show few signs of slowing down."
503,2023-05-13T11:35:00+00:00,Opening up about his anxiety and depression helped this former Google executive be a better leader,"When leaders of public companies and other high-profile institutions start speaking openly about their experiences with depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges, the veil of shame that conceals many of these conversations at work starts to lift.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

It can begin with an executive simply being open with their teams about their personal challenges. Or it can involve more formal storytelling. Not only does storytelling heal, it opens the door for true change.

Through my podcast, I met Newton Cheng who serves as Director of Health and Performance at Google (he is also a world champion powerlifter). Cheng and I had a frank and inspiring conversation, and I asked him who inspired him to be public about taking mental health leave in 2021. Cheng explained he found a role model in his former Google colleague Daryll Henrich.

âHe was a VP and very respected leader in our overall IT organization,â Cheng explained on the podcast. âAnd I first heard his story in a management training aimed at managers. Not only had [Henrich] shared his story with the entire company, but Googleâs L&D team took his story and embedded it into a key manager training course. The story sat in my memory for 10 years before I experienced struggles that were similar, and it helped me feel less alone when I finally needed it.â

I tracked down Henrich, curious about the origin of a story that had clearly influenced many. Henrich, a former VP of engineering at Google, doesnât think his journey to mental wellness at work needed to be as hard as he made it. But at the time, he had few role models.

When Henrich first began experiencing anxiety and depression in 2006, he felt alone. âThere was no one in the industry I could look to and say, 'Oh, there's an example of someone who was able to get through or integrate that experience and thrive anyway.'""

Story continues

His recovery process was slow. âI didn't take any medication. And I believe now in retrospect, it led me to a much longer slog through recovery. But I was stubborn. I asked my therapist at one point, When am I, quote, unquote, 'better?' This doesn't feel like, Oh, I got over a cold.

âIt got to the point where it was so long and drawn out that I lost my baseline, and I didn't remember what normal even felt like. The therapist said, âIt begins to get better as it becomes something that happened to you rather than something that is happening to you. But it is always going to be with you.â And he said that as I begin to integrate the experience into my ongoing life, that's when I get better.â

It took Henrich years to feel comfortable enough to open up about his anxiety and depression. Growing up in rural Pennsylvania, he never expected to end up on the management track at Google. But he was promoted quickly, and by his late twenties, was managing a staff of 45. Around that time, he also started noticing disturbing physical symptoms and mood shifts that preoccupied him.

These were signs of anxiety, but Henrich ignored them until ""it got so bad that obsessive thoughts about my own well being led to a severe hypochondria, which led to panic disorder and a night in the hospital."" After this, he finally started therapy and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. Henrich calls 2006-2008 the worst period of his life, where he constantly worried everything he'd built at Google was at risk.

""I worried I'd gone from up-and-coming rockstar to what I viewed as weak,"" Henrich says. His mental health struggle was a source of terror and shame. âEveryone I looked up to seemed invincible. I put other Google executives on pedestals. I felt like I did not have anybody to talk to.

âThe track that I was on that was not sustainable and being interrupted by this experience was a taste of humble pie. But it forced me to address the life habits and work habitsÂ  that were completely unsustainable and really harming me.

In retrospect, Henrich is grateful for the experience. And as he began to share his story, he realized that heâs become a role model he wished he had.

It was only when one of his direct reports came to him in 2009 to ask for a mental health leave that Henrich was moved to speak publicly about his anxiety and depression. He started sharing his story throughout Google, and included his mental health journey in management training courses he was increasingly asked to give.

âIn addition to my job, which was running a big chunk of internal systems at Google, I made that my side hustle, internally speaking out about this or whether it was just talking to people who got sent my way as that network grew. And ultimately, teaching leadership classes. The first or second slide of every leadership class I ever taught was about taking care of yourself. It's the âput on your mask before helping someone else kind of thingâ. And so literally, any public speaking that I ever did internally to Google included this.â

Henrichâs story even went viral on the Google Intranet. ""People would tell me it was brave, and it felt like it should have gone all wrong for my career. Sharing my story didnât destroy my career at all, and actually led to a lot of upside for my career.""

Henrich is what Kelly Greenwood, CEO of the workforce mental health non profit Mind Share Partners, calls a leader ally. A leader allyâs story is an authentic, vulnerable, and supportive message that includes a personal experience with mental health, which can range from high stress to burnout to grief to a diagnosable condition. It can be past or present, a one-time episode, or an ongoing challenge, and it may or may not have affected work.

As we can see with Henrich, leader allies help normalize mental health challenges at work, and reduce the stigma. They signal that experiencing mental health challenges is ok, and most important, they model mentally healthy behaviors.

Henrich credits his recovery from mental illness with his transformation as a leader who eventually built a team of thousands. He developed empathy as a boss. ""Good human values as a leader creates a safe and compassionate place where people want to work,"" he says.

The userâs account has since been suspended - u/trippy_art_special

Google has launched a new tool to help people identify fake AI-generated images online, following warnings that the technology could become a wellspring for misinformation.

The tool, named About This Image, will be integrated into Google search so users can see âadditional contextâ about pictures served up by the search engine. Information includes when the image first appeared on Google and any related news stories.

Cory Dunton, Googleâs product manager for search, said: âWith this background information on an image, you can get a better understanding of whether an image is reliable â or if you need to take a second look.â

The feature, which is being launched later this month, will tell users where an image was first seen online and when it was first picked up by the Google search engine.

It will also say where potentially fake images first came from, Google said. The company, which has widely been seen as an AI laggard after Microsoftâs ChatGPT-based Bing Chat took the world by storm, has recently sounded a more cautious note on AI development.

The new tool comes after a Chicago construction worker claimed to have created a picture of the Pope wearing a Balenciaga-style puffer jacket while âtrying to figure out ways to make something funnyâ.

Pablo Xavier told Buzzfeed in March that he had used the AI art tool Midjourney, adding: âI just thought it was funny to see the Pope in a funny jacket.â

Tools such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion or OpenAIâs DALL-E can be used to generate hyperrealistic images of people in situations that never actually happened.

Pictures of Donald Trump appearing to be arrested by police went viral earlier this year after Bellingcat co-founder Eliot Higgins created them using Midjourney. Eliot Higgins used the AI image generator Midjourney to mock up Donald Trump's arrest from https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/status/1637927681734987777 - Eliot Higgins

A 2021 study into artificially generated faces, by Lancaster University academic Sophie Nightingale and University of California professor Hany Farid, was one of the first notable studies into recognition of AI-generated images.

Story continues

The duo set up a generative adversarial network (GAN) AI system to create pictures of human faces. They then asked 300 people to rate the fake faces as real or fake, mixing them in with genuine portraits of real people.

They concluded that âcurrent techniques are not efficient or accurate enough to contend with the torrent of daily uploadsâ.

The National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of GCHQ, has warned that AI technology can be âcoaxed into creating toxic contentâ as well as âhallucinate incorrect factsâ.

Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

âAs I mentioned at the beginning of this quarterly letter, we took advantage of the meltdown in technology platforms to initiate new positions in companies in which we had already been shareholders in the past and whose valuation did not, until now, provide a sufficiently high margin of safety. Such is the case of PayPal and Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU).

In the case of Baidu, as many will know, it is known as the âChinese Googleâ. The company has been the leading Internet search engine in the Asian country for years, which has given it a historically privileged position to monetize, through online advertising, a huge user base. However, the rise of two types of applications has called into question the sustainability of its business model. On the one hand, mobile social apps, such as ByteDanceâs well-known TikTok, have emerged as a new model of online consumption, generating a new platform through which to monetize Internet users. On the other hand, even more disruptive in the long term, is the emergence of the so-called super apps: a sort of virtual Swiss Army knives that allow users to access many products and services without having to leave their interface at any time, making Baiduâs traditional search engine less attractive. In this field, Tencent (with its super app Weixin/WeChat), Alibaba (Alipay) and Meituan certainly stand out. These two factors have caused Baiduâs online advertising market share to drop from 17% in 2017 to less than 7% estimated for 2022.34 To this deterioration, we should add the collapse in market value of its stake in iQiyi (video platform controlled by Baidu) and its equity holdings such as Trip.com (hotel and flight platform) â¦â (Click here to read the full text)

âNew positions initiated in Q4 included shortsÂ International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBMâs 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the companyâs legacy businesses.â

If you are not interested in reading the details, you can skip to the 5 Most Successful Shark Tank Products Ever in 2023.

Shark Tank on ABC, which debuted in 2009 and is currently in its 14th season, has developed into a business equivalent of American Idol. Tens of thousands of small company owners compete year for the chance to present their goods in front of a nationwide audience of millions and close a deal with one of the show's prominent investors.

Each season, around two-thirds of the nearly 100 entrepreneurs that make it on the show leave with a handshake agreement and detailed expansion plans from their investors. However, a review of 112 businesses that were given deals on the show's seasons 8 through 13 finds that almost half of those deals were never finalized, and another 15% have altered conditions once the cameras are switched off.

Shark Tank Products To The Rescue

Millions of Americans lack jobs because of the coronavirus-caused economic downturn, and business owners are battling to stay open and need clarification about their future course. Due to this, the money-smart investors on ABC's Shark Tank offered some financial guidance, including how to save, manage rent, and continue to be productive at home. In April 2020, the U.S. economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs, leaving many people needing clarification about how to cover bills like rent. In actuality, during the first week of April 2020, approximately one-third of American renters of apartments failed to make their payments.

Some people campaigned for rent strikes and demanded that the federal government impose rent freezes and provide aid. According to CNBC, a temporary ban on evictions has been implemented in many jurisdictions to safeguard renters amid the pandemic. The numbers behind Shark Tank are genuinely staggering. With over $221 million pledged by the Sharks on screen, it's no surprise that so many entrepreneurs vie for the chance to appear on the show. Of the 1218 products pitched, 729 managed to secure a deal, with an impressive success rate of 59.85%. The average investment per deal is just over $300,000, with average equity taken at 24.99%.

Story continues

However, these figures have changed significantly over the show's 14 seasons. One of the original Sharks, Mark Cuban, has invested the most significant amount, a whopping $61.5 million, and has struck the most deals on screen (218). On the other hand, Kevin O'Leary has appeared in most episodes (291) and seen the most pitches (1161). Interestingly, Mark Cuban also entered into the most partnerships in total (104), with Lori Greiner being his most frequent partner (42 times).

Regarding states and territories, California leads the way in terms of deals struck (196) and money invested ($64,346,000). However, when the population size is adjusted, it's D.C. that comes out on top, with an average of 10.2 deals struck and $4,314,439 invested per million residents. On the flip side, South Dakota and Wyoming have 0 appearances on the show.

These numbers highlight the enormous impact that Shark Tank has had on the world of entrepreneurship and the varied landscape of opportunity and investment across different regions of the U.S.

Shark Tank has developed into a powerful platform for entrepreneurs to receive visibility and financing for their cutting-edge goods and services throughout the years, in addition to being a great source of entertainment. The show has featured many outlandish and bizarre pitches, but it has also featured some truly incredible ideas that have improved many lives.

A.I. is expected to revolutionize productivity through the introduction of advanced generative assistants like ChatGPT and Midjourney, potentially rendering 300 million knowledge sector workers jobless according to Goldman Sachs.

However, the tech community is split over how best to contain the risks, with Elon Musk pushing for a delay in next-generation A.I. research while Bill Gates opposes it.

Speaking to NBCâsÂ Meet the Press, Schmidt believes no one outside of the industry could possibly be versed enough in the technology to define either what the âreasonable boundariesâ of A.I. should be or where to put them.

âMy concern with any kind of premature regulation, especially from the government, is itâs always written in a restrictive way,â Schmidt said in commentsÂ broadcast on Sunday. âWhat Iâd much rather do is have an agreement among the key players that we will not have a race to the bottom.â

Schmidt isnât just familiar with the technology through his timeÂ running Google, one of the leaders in the field along with Sam Altmanâs OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM and Baidu of China.

U.S. officials are collecting comments from the public on how best to regulate A.I. until June 10th, by which point Europe may have also fine-tuned its plans.

âThe key issue from my perspective is how do we put guardrails on the worst behaviors and how do we get international agreement on what those things are,â Schmidt said.

Conversational product search has the potential to reshape a key element of Amazonâs core retail business. The search bar at the top of the app and home page in recent years have become the default gateway for millions of shoppers seeking to find a specific product. More than half of US shoppers say they start product searches on Amazon.com, a higher share than Google, according a survey conducted earlier this year by Jungle Scout, a maker of software for sellers on Amazon.

Early deployments of generative AI by Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.âs Google and others have been beset by errors in response to basic questions. But they also show how a beefed-up Microsoft Bing or Google search could offer users a more valuable way to find products.

Asking Microsoft Bing â which is powered by OpenAIâs ChatGPT â to show the five best electric razors pulled up a roster of five products, including citations to reviews from Menâs Health and GQ, along with links to stores selling the products. The same search on Amazon yields a pair of ads, followed by dozens of products.

Amazonâs search experience has been criticized in recent years for the increased share of results devoted to ads and other sponsored content.

Generative AI uses vast quantities of data to assemble large language models that can help create text or images following a prompt. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said on an earnings call last month that the technology âpresents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience.â

Amazon Web Services, the companyâs cloud-computing unit, in April announced a set of services that rely on advances in generative AI. They have yet to be widely released. Meanwhile, the company is hoping to use similar technology to improve its Alexa voice assistant, Insider reported. Amazon is also building a team to use artificial intelligence tools to create photos and videos for advertising campaigns, the Information reported this month.

The gift, disclosed in a filing Monday, doesnât specify who received the 5.2 million shares, which were evenly split between newly converted Class A stock and Class C stock. They could be directed to charity, or given to other financial vehicles or trusts.

Google didnât respond to a request for comment on the filing.

Brin and co-founder Larry Page saw their wealth surge by a combined $18 billion last week, their biggest gain since February 2021, after investor frenzy around artificial intelligence boosted Alphabetâs stock. The day before his share gift, the Mountain View, California-based company announced a more conversational search engine and said it was making its AI-powered chatbot more broadly available.

Brinâs net worth is now $100.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His fortune, the ninth-highest in the world, is largely made up of a combination of Class B and Class C shares of Alphabet. Heâs sold more than $10 billion worth of shares since the companyâs initial public offering in 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The stock gift follows a similar move by Brin late last year, when he transferred about 1 million shares. He also used some of his Alphabet stock to set up a new nonprofit called Catalyst4 focused on health and climate change, though filings show the majority of its funding so far comes from Tesla Inc. shares sold near their peak in late 2021.

May 15 (Reuters) - OpenAI is preparing to release a new open-source language model to the public, The Information reported on Monday, citing a person with knowledge of the plan.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, known for producing prose or poetry on command, has gained widespread attention in Silicon Valley as investors see generative AI as the next big growth area for tech companies.

In January, Microsoft Corp announced a multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI, deepening its ties with the startup and setting the stage for more competition with rival Alphabet Inc's Google.

Meta Platforms Inc is now rushing to join competitors Microsoft and Google in releasing generative AI products capable of creating human-like writing, art and other content.

OpenAI is unlikely to release a model that is competitive with GPT, the report said.

Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst cut you may have missed since yesterday: downgrades for Alphabet, First Solar, SoFi Technologies, and Mid-America Apartment Communities.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Alphabet downgraded to Hold due to uncertainty surrounding the AI transition

Loop Capital downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $125.00, as InvestingPro reported in real time. The downgrade move comes after the shares rally following the companyâs successful I/O event that âopened some eyes to the companyâs strong position in AI.â

The downgrade is due to concerns about the company's ability to maintain its dominant position during a technology transformation. The firm considers search competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) a lesser threat than the risk of displacement from behavioral change as users interact more with AI assistants to find information. Furthermore, the firm believes long-term structural uncertainties surrounding the AI transition may make investors nervous and limit the stock's valuation.

First Solar downgraded after a 26% stock jump

Wolfe Research downgraded First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) to Peerperform from Outperform on fundamental valuation.

The stock gained 26% on Friday on constructive Treasury guidance on domestic content. The move was much larger than expected. According to the firm, First Solar stock has more than fully recovered from the sell-off post-earnings and is at a new 15-year high.

Shares fell more than 4% yesterday.

2 more downgrades

Wedbush downgraded SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) to Underperform from Neutral and cut its price target to $2.50 from $5.00. Shares fell nearly 5% yesterday.

Wolfe Research downgraded Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) to Underperform from Peerperform with a price target of $137.00 on expected growth deceleration.

Japan aspires to be ""number one again through web3 innovation"", but must first overcome ingrained domestic obstacles, a key advisor to the Japanese government's national strategy tells Yahoo Finance UK.

Once recognised as a global leader in car manufacturing and electronic goods, Japan's economy has been stagnating in recent years.

Now, the Japanese government has outlined a national strategy aimed at reclaiming its top position through web3 innovation, the third generation of internet services that leverages blockchain technology for peer-to-peer transactions and the creation of digital assets.

In February, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida expressed his support for the potential of blockchain technology in addressing the nation's economic challenges.

On this week's episode of The Crypto Mile, Yahoo Finance UK spoke to Sota Watanabe, the founder of Astar Network and a member of the Japanese government's web3 task force. Watanabe outlined Japan's new initiative to become ""number one again"", though web3 innovations.

He said: ""A lot of the Japanese companies, such as Toyota (TYT.L) and Sony (6758.T), would like to work in web3 and the Japanese government made web3 a national strategy back in September and published a web3 whitepaper.

""So, we are now in the age of web3 and Japan needs to create the Sony of this era, but if we cannot do this, our economy is going to shrink.""

I am honored to be on the cover of the latest issue of Forbes Japan! Thanks for the Christmas gift @forbesjapan ð 

Astar is getting a lot of tractions and recognition in Japan. We keep building and try to lead web3 in Japan. pic.twitter.com/5lnIQcsHju

â Sota Watanabe (@WatanabeSota) December 23, 2022

The entrepreneur, who was on the cover of Forbes Japan's December edition, said that because ""Japanese people are conservative compared to Americans and Europeans, a Japanese company needs to make one successful web3 use-case, so the other companies will feel confident to follow this lead"".

Watanabe said Japan missed out on the web2, lacking its own versions of Google (GOOG), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), unlike China, which boasts Tencent (0700.HK), WeChat, and Alibaba (BABA).

""At one stage Japan was number one, but we are losing right now, and web3 is an opportunity for Japanese companies and as a country,"" Watanabe said.

Investment in software design

Watanabe said Japan is heavily involved in hardware and electronic goods manufacturing, but less in world-leading software design.

He said: ""As a country Japanese people and Japanese companies need to invest more in software, such as creating web3 platforms on blockchains and with digital wallets.""

However, he added that Japanese companies are still fixated on domestic markets.

""Although the Japanese market is big many companies only provide products and services available in Japan,"" he said.

Because Japan is the fastest ageing population in the world, with almost 29% of the population over 65-years-old, the domestic market will keep contracting.

""Because of the ageing demographic, Japan needs a company, founder or product that makes money outside of Japan to grow the economy, this is what the entire country needs to focus on,"" Watanabe added.

Japan's rapidly aging population, driven by a declining fertility rate and increasing life expectancy, is having significant economic implications, according to an IMF report.

It is predicted that by 2030, one in three Japanese people will be 65 or older. This demographic shift is impacting economic growth by increasing the social security burden and reducing the labour force.

Involvement in the web3 sector ownership is still heavily skewed towards younger age groups, older audiences are underrepresented. Japanese companies wishing to diversify into the web3 sector may need to look elsewhere.

According to a report by DataPortal, internationally, fewer than one in 20 internet users aged 55 to 64 own any cryptocurrency, and the majority of users of web3 products such as Defi, digital wallets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are members of the Generation Z demographic.

Shares in the Google-owner had lagged behind other megacaps this year amid fears it was losing ground in the race to deploy AI products. Yet since it unveiled its latest AI tools at a developerâs conference last week, the stock has advanced 9%, adding $115 billion in market value and erasing its underperformance against peers like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

âInvestors are questioning whether Alphabet is a winner or loser as AI changes the landscape,â said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt. âThis puts them more solidly in the winner camp.â

With excitement around AI building, Alphabet had largely missed out on the stellar gains seen by many of its tech peers, particularly as the rapid growth of OpenAIâs ChatGPT is seen as a potential threat to the dominance of its search business. So last weekâs announcement of a more conversational search engine and that the company is making its AI-powered chatbot more broadly available provided a timely boost.

Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak was among Wall Street analysts heartened by Googleâs presentation after what he called âAI overhangâ in the stock.

If the company can successfully integrate the new AI features to its products that serve hundreds of millions of people, it should âbuild further confidence in AI driven upside to come,â Nowak wrote in a research note after the event.

For Bill Ackmanâs Pershing Square, the stockâs gains have come at an opportune moment. On Monday, the hedge fund disclosed the purchase of more than 10 million of the firmâs Class A and Class C shares in the first quarter, worth about $1.2 billion at current prices.

Story continues

Others have also benefited. Google co-founder Sergey Brin gifted Alphabet shares worth roughly $600 million on Thursday during a week that saw his wealth grow by the most in more than two years.

Even after such a strong rally, Alphabet isnât expensive relative to peers. At 19 times, the stockâs price-to-projected profit ratio is the highest in months, yet itâs still much cheaper than Microsoft and Apple, which are priced at 29 and 27 times, respectively.

Of course, there are still plenty of skeptics. Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson says lingering concerns about AI risks will prevent Alphabetâs cheaper market valuation multiple from expanding. The analyst cut his rating on the stock to hold from buy on Monday, even though he sees the company as a major beneficiary of AI adoption in the long run.

âWe do not see this as an existential threat to Google, but this behavior will become a competitive force against its dominance in connecting users to information,â he wrote.

Tech Chart of the Day

Alphabetâs surge in the last week has propelled its relative strength index beyond the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock may have risen too far, too quickly. Even after a 0.8% pullback on Monday, the shares remain in overbought territory.

Top Tech Stories

Artificial intelligence has been at the very top of executiveâs minds this earnings season â and itâs increasingly becoming a factor in determining companiesâ share-price performance. Elon Muskâs X Corp., the parent company of Twitter, has made its first acquisition: a tech talent recruiting service called Laskie, according to a person familiar with the matter. Michael Burry, the money manager made famous in The Big Short, now has a Big Long when it comes to China. He boosted his bullish bets on e-commerce giants JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., even as other hedge funds cooled on the nationâs reopening trades. Microsoft Corp.âs $69 billion takeover bid for games developer Activision Blizzard Inc. came back from the brink after the European Union gave its blessing for one of the biggest deals in history. Nelson Peltz, the activist investor who launched and then abandoned a proxy fight earlier this year at Walt Disney Co., has recently added to his stake in the company, according to a person familiar with his holdings. Rakuten Group Inc. plans to issue new shares to raise Â¥332.2 billion ($2.4 billion) to shore up capital depleted by its loss-churning mobile unit.

531,2023-05-12T08:18:57+00:00,What Does Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Share Price Indicate?,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the companyâs outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Letâs examine Alphabetâs valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if thereâs still a bargain opportunity.

Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet

What's The Opportunity In Alphabet?

Great news for investors â Alphabet is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $159.83, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Alphabetâs beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Alphabet? earnings-and-revenue-growth

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that itâs the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 57%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.

Story continues

Are you a potential investor? If youâve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isnât fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means itâs not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.

The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, or 257 points lower, and the Nasdaq gained 0.1%.

Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) fell more than 1% after reporting quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street expectations, weighed down by a fall in lumber prices and a weaker start to spring.

âWe view these results negatively, and see an incremental negative read-through to Loweâs (NYSE:LOW) and other home-oriented retailers,â Wedbush said in a note as the broader retail sector fell more than 1% on the day.

Sentiment on retailers was also hurt by data showing U.S. retail sales fell short of expectations in April, signaling waning consumer strength.

Retail sales were âheld back by weakness in gasoline station sales, which was surprising given the increase in prices at the pump during the month,â Jefferies said.

Energy was the biggest drag on the broader market as weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data overshadowed expectations for a step up in energy demand.

The International Energy Agency hiked its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 barrels per day to a record 102 million bpd.

Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Targa Resources Inc (NYSE:TRGP) were among the biggest decliners in energy.

Technology stocks resumed their upward momentum, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter boosted by progress on its $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) after the deal won approval from the European Union a day earlier.

The approval of the deal from regulators in the EU is an ""incremental positive"" for Microsoftâs appeal against the UK competition watchdog, which recently blocked the deal.

Financials continued to drag on the broader market, though a 2% climb in Capital One (NYSE:COF) helped keep losses in check after the Warren Buffetâs Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) took a new nearly $1B position in the company.

Also weighing the broader market, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reaffirmed that the U.S. could default as soon as June 1 should Congress fail to reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling.

President Joe Biden and congressional leaders are set to meet on Tuesday to find a resolution to lift the U.S. government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.

The policy change only applies to personal Google Accounts and not to those for organizations like schools or businesses.

541,2023-05-11T18:40:12+00:00,"Stock market today: Dow closes lower as energy, Home Depot slip","Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Tuesday as a slump in energy and a Home Depot-led slip in retailers following disappointing quarterly results weighed on stocks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, or 336 points lower, the Nasdaq fell 0.1%, and the S&P 500 was down 0.6%.

Home Depot (NYSE:HD) fell more than 2% after reporting quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street expectations, weighed down by a fall in lumber prices and a weaker start to spring.

âWe view these results negatively, and see an incremental negative read-through to Loweâs (NYSE:LOW) and other home-oriented retailers,â Wedbush said in a note as the broader retail sector fell more than 1% on the day.

Sentiment on retailers was also hurt by data showing U.S. retail sales fell short of expectations in April, signaling waning consumer strength.

Retail sales were âheld back by weakness in gasoline station sales, which was surprising given the increase in prices at the pump during the month,â Jefferies said.

Energy was the biggest drag on the broader market as weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data overshadowed expectations for a step up in energy demand.

The International Energy Agency hiked its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 barrels per day to a record 102 million bpd.

Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), and Targa Resources Inc (NYSE:TRGP) were among the biggest decliners in energy.

Technology stocks resumed their upward momentum, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter boosted by progress on its $69 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) after the deal won approval from the European Union a day earlier.

The approval of the deal from regulators in the EU is an ""incremental positive"" for Microsoftâs appeal against the UK competition watchdog, which recently blocked the deal.

Financials continued to drag on the broader market, though a 2% climb in Capital One (NYSE:COF) helped keep losses in check after Warren Buffetâs Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) took a new nearly $1B position in the company.

Story continues

Also weighing on the broader market, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reaffirmed that the U.S. could default as soon as June 1 should Congress fail to reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling.

President Joe Biden will reportedly cut his trip to the G-7 leaders summit short to ramp up efforts to make progress on the debt ceiling deal.

544,2023-05-11T17:51:18+00:00,OpenAI CEO calls on government to regulate AI,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate the development of AI at a time when the technology is gaining traction across the tech industry and beyond.

âWe think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,â Altman said in his opening remarks.

âFor example, the US government might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities.â

Both IBM Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery and NYU Professor Gary Marcus, who also testified during the hearing, similarly called for regulating AI and making the technology more transparent so that users know when they are interacting with AI.

AI, and specifically generative AI that can be used to generate text, images, and more using models trained on data collected via the internet, has exploded in popularity since the launch of OpenAIâs ChatGPT in 2022. Since then, Microsoft (MSFT), which has invested billions in OpenAI, has launched its generative AI-powered Bing search engine and chat bot.

Last week, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) debuted a series of new technologies that use generative AI as part of its Google I/O conference including a version of its powerful search engine. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

During the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) illustrated the power of generative AI by using a version of ChatGPT trained on his prior floor speeches and a type of AI voice cloning software to read a completely made up opening statement that sounded like something Blumenthal might have said on his own.

âIf you were listening from home, you might have thought that voice was mine and the words from me, but in fact, that voice was not mine. The words were not mine,â Blumenthal explained.

Senators raised several questions throughout the hearing about the potential for AI to be used to manipulate elections or cause other real-world harms.

Story continues

âIs it going to be like the printing press? That diffused knowledge and power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary everyday individuals that lead to greater flourishing, that lead above all to greater liberty?â Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked.

âOr is it going to be more like the atom bomb? Huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences severe, terrible, continue to haunt us to this day?â

Altman, meanwhile, said that he sees the technology as a âprinting press moment.â But when pressed about the potential for misuse, the CEO said he is looking toward the government for help.

âMy worst fears are that we, the field, the technology, the industry, cause significant harm to the world,â Altman said. âI think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.â Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

Both Altman and Marcus called on senators to create a new regulatory body that can monitor AI companies and provide licenses to deploy AI models.

Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) equated the idea to how energy companies need licenses to build nuclear power plants.

While the roughly three-hour hearing saw plenty of questions from senators, there was little in the way of concrete next steps.

And as senators and witnesses pointed out repeatedly, the technology will continue to advance regardless of whether regulations are put in place or not.

550,2023-05-11T16:02:21+00:00,Expedia Asked Google to Crack Down on Bait and Switch Hotel Rates,"Expedia Group's Peter Kern spoke at its Seattle headquarters on May 9 to partners at the company's annual Explore conference. Source: Expedia Group

Expedia Group told Google that the bait and switch tactics that some online travel agencies deploy in Googleâs price comparison feature, Google Hotels, is âscrewed upâ and Google made some satisfactory changes.

Thatâs according to Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern, who discussed the issue with Skift last week, and mentioned it at the companyâs partner conference in Seattle, as well.

Expedia spends billions of dollars every year advertising its listings on Google.com, travel.google.com, and Google-owned Youtube, all of which are important travel advertising vehicles.

âWe went to them (Google) as a big customer, and said, âYour marketplace is screwed up, and we spend a lot of money in it. And if you want us to keep spending a lot of money in it, youâve got to make it fair. You donât need to advantage us. Just take out people that are misleading customers, and weâre good with that. Weâre not asking for special treatment.'â

Kern said Google used its own tech to make improvements, and they did a fairly good job.

Google doesnât see any alleged discussions between the two companies in the same way that Kern did.

A Google spokesperson said it wouldnât be accurate to say that discussions with one individual customer spurred price accuracy improvements.

âWe have always worked hard to ensure that people can see accurate prices when they look for hotels on Google,â the company said in a statement. âOver the years, weâve incorporated user feedback to continuously improve the systems that make this possible.â

Best Hotels Lists a Lower Rate, Misleadingly

Even this week, the issue persisted.

For example, on its initial listing in Googleâs price comparison feature, Google Hotels, Expedia on Sunday listed a superior room at the Eurostars Grand Marina in Barcelona for a May 30-31 stay for $216. When you click through to book it the total price would be $232 if you prepay for the room, and $245 if you pay at the property.

However, Best Hotels on Sunday listed the same property and bed type for a May 30-31 stay on Google at a lower price than Expedia did, $183 for Best Hotels versus $216 for Expedia. Despite Best Hotelsâ enticing $183 rate, it turned out that Best Hotelsâ total price for that room was actually higher than Expediaâs. The Best Hotels rate was $236 if you prepay versus $232 for Expedia, and $251 if you pay at the hotel versus $245 with Expedia.

Story continues

So Google allowed Best Hotels to lure travelers with a lower rate than Expedia offered for the Eurostars Grand Marina although Expedia was the one to actually offer lower total rates.

Expedia Took Its Concerns to Google

These sorts of misleading pricing practices take place all too often on Google, and on other price comparison, or metasearch sites, as well. Skift didnât have to look a long time to find such an example; it surfaced in the second listing we examined.

âSo we went to them (Google) and basically said, âLook, your stated position is your search is designed to improve the customer experience. But you are allowing all these bait and switch players (to be on Google). And when you click through, the customer actually gets a worse outcome,â Kern said.

Kern wasnât commenting on the Best Hotels example, which Skift found this week. He was talking about the issue in general terms.

âConsumers get lost in that bait and switch,â Kern said. âThatâs why itâs worked for a thousand years.â

Kern said Expedia told Google ââyou should clean that up.â And I think they agreed with us. They went about creating some technological fixes. I think they did a reasonably good job in making it better, although not perfect.â

Google claimed it always aims for the best user experience for people trying to obtain travel information, and that Google acts on feedback from both partners and travelers.

Hereâs Googleâs price accuracy policy. Among those policies, Google levies suspensions for travel companies that engage in deceptive practices.

Expedia has its own technology, which several large hotel chains are using, to ensure that online travel agencies and others arenât offering hotel rates, such as wholesale prices for a stay, that they arenât authorized to sell.

The game was previously available in limited regions on the Google Play store and through the company's Mavis Hub.

The card-based strategy game, which provides players with free non-NFT ""starter"" characters, will first launch in the Apple store across Latin America and Asia in countries including Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. The game has 1.5 million installs across all platforms and plans to continue its global expansion via Google and Apple mobile users.

Sky Mavis is also launching Mavis Market, a curated NFT marketplace powered by the company's native Ronin blockchain. From Wednesday, some collectibles from third-party game or dapp developers who deploy on Ronin will be available on the marketplace. The company also plans to launch a merch store.

âSky Mavis remains committed to our vision of a player-owner digital nation and is excited to work with app stores to open our ecosystem to a new generation of Lunacians,â said Sky Mavis CEO Trung Nguyen.

Axie Infinity has worked to rebound from a $625 million hack last year, overhauling Ronin's core systems in March to make the network more decentralized and secure. In addition, the company also partnered with game development studios, including Tribes Studio, Bali Games, Directive Games and Bowled.io, to expand the Axie Infinity universe, allowing select games to use the Axie IP."

556,2023-05-11T14:49:30+00:00,Tech Giants Embrace Stock Buybacks: Its Impact on ETFs,"Share repurchases, or stock buybacks, have become increasingly prevalent in tech companies' earnings this year. According to Cornell University assistant professor Nick Guest, buybacks don't create or destroy a lot of wealth. Instead, they serve as an opportunity for management to signal their belief that the stock is undervalued, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.

Some of the biggest buyback announcements this year came from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META, formerly known as Facebook.

Understanding the Criticisms and Data

Critics argue that buybacks can be used to manipulate share prices, contribute to excessive executive compensation, and limit cash available for investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing growth and profitability. However, Guest's research comparing companies that repurchase shares with those that don't has found no significant evidence supporting these criticisms.

Major Tech Buybacks: Google and Apple

Recent buyback announcements from Alphabet and Apple, amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively, have drawn significant attention. While these figures may appear large, they represent only 5.2% of Google's market cap, making them relatively moderate when adjusted for market-wide comparisons.

Why Companies Choose Buybacks

Share repurchases, or buybacks, are when a company uses its cash to buy back some of its outstanding shares from the market. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, which increases the ownership stake of existing shareholders and boosts the earnings per share (EPS) ratio.

Guest suggests that stock buybacks offer more flexibility than dividends, as they can be temporarily cut during downtime and reduce the potential for cash misuse on management's pet projects. Additionally, repurchased shares can be used to compensate employees, offering benefits other than improving long-term profitability or creating additional investment opportunities.

Story continues

Ideal Conditions for Buybacks

Along with Ali Ragih, a VerityData analyst, we also believe that the best time for buybacks is when the company's valuation is low, as they get the most value for their buyback. For example, if Google spends $15 billion on buybacks, a lower stock price would yield more shares for the same dollar value. Companies with high free cash flow and limited investment opportunities, like Alphabet, are well-positioned for buybacks.

Tech Leads Buybacks Most of the Time

We all know that the tech shares were battered massively last year due to rising rates and their valuations got corrected. This opened up opportunities for them to go for solid buybacks this year. According to a recent report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, tech companies accounted for 28.8% of all buybacks in the third quarter quarter of 2022 versus Q2 2022's 32.8% and Q3 2021's 28.2%.

Which ETFs Can Benefit From Tech Buybacks?

There are several ETFs that track indices that focus on companies with high buyback rates. Here are four examples:

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)

This is one of the most popular and liquid ETFs in the market. For instance, Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet, which are among the top holdings of QQQ.

Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT

This ETF also has exposure to some of the biggest buyback achievers in the tech sector, such as Apple, Microsoft and Cisco Systems (CSCO).

Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF (PKW)

The NASDAQ US BuyBack Achievers Index comprises of US securities issued by corporations that have effected a net reduction in shares outstanding of 5% or more in the trailing 12 months. The fund charges 61 bps in fees.

Any Caveat?

With increasing backlash against buybacks, shareholders may see fewer of them in the future if disincentives increase or restrictions are imposed. In his State of the Union Address in early 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden will urge Congress to pass a 20% minimum tax on billionaires and increase the new 1% tax on corporate stock buybacks to 4%, the White House said.

This could lead to firms retaining cash or switching to dividends, which may have negative consequences, such as higher taxes on dividends compared to repurchases that generate capital gains.

The internet content industry remains one of the biggest, fastest-growing domains that have ever-increasing growth prospects due to the sheer number of users in its addressable market. As of today the internet penetration stands at about 59%, which means there are still billions of people in the world who are yet to gain access to the internet. Internet content consumption keeps growing as more and more people buy smartphones and spend time online. On average an internet user spends 6.5 hours on the internet per day. Where users spend most of their time is where the money is. Thatâs why the race for advertising dollars keeps raging in the internet content industry as companies find new and innovative ways to grab their audienceâs attention.

Audio

One of the hottest trends in the internet content industry is audio. According to data from market research firm GWI, a typical internet user spends about 1 hour and 38 minutes per day listening to music streaming services like Spotify.

Thatâs why companies have started to spend a fortune on improving their audio content and audio delivery channels. YouTube, which is the worldâs biggest video platform, is also joining the audio race. YouTube Music and Premium service has already surpassed 80 million paid subscribers. Earlier this year, the company confirmed to Tech Crunch that it will bring audio and video-first podcasts to YouTube Music for users in the U.S. The company was reportedly working on features that will allow users to switch to audio mode while watching video podcasts.

AI in the Internet Content Industry

The internet content industry is also embracing AI and is already seeing its benefits.

During its Q4 earnings call, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)âs management talked about its AI-related features to reignite ads growth and other initiatives to make the platform more lucrative for advertisers. Hereâs what the company said at the time:

âWe see opportunities for continued gains in the near and medium-term, with our AI investments powering a lot of this work as we continue to improve ads ranking and enable increased automation for advertisers to make it easier for them to run campaigns and use our systems to optimize their performance. Another opportunity we have is to further scale onsite conversions through products like click-to-message, lead ads and shop ads.

Click-to-message ads continue to grow quickly and we believe they are bringing incremental demand onto our platform, with over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively using click-to-messaging ads on our platform. We see further opportunity as we continue to scale click-to-WhatsApp ads and are investing in growing newer formats like shop ads. Over the long-term, we are investing heavily in AI to develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies and continue building new tools that will make it easier for advertisers to create and deliver more relevant and engaging ads. Moving now to our efficiency work, we took significant actions in 2022 to operate more efficiently. In Q4, we made the difficult decision to layoff employees while deprioritizing certain projects and curtailing non-headcount-related expenses.â

Apparently Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)âs strategy and new product initiatives worked as the company reported upbeat revenue for the first quarter of 2023.Â  The companyâs short-form video content feature âReelsâ was one of the factors that contributed to the growth. Mark Zuckerberg said in the companyâs latest earnings call:

âWhen we started this work last year, our business wasnât performing as well as I wanted. But now weâre increasingly doing this work from a position of strength.â

The Rise of Short-Form Video Content

The success of Reels wasnât surprising though. In a bid to compete with TikTok, which has posted record levels of growth in North America and Asia, companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) poured their resources to roll out short-form video features. And those efforts are paying off. During the first quarter of 2023, YouTube Shorts received 50 billion daily views, up from 30 billion in the prior-year quarter.

TikTok has tapped into perhaps the most lucrative areas of the internet content industry â short-form video content. The appâs top-notch algorithm and suggestions have hooked billions. Several estimates show TikTok is the most addictive social media app, with an average TikTok user in the US spending a whopping 29 hours a month on the app, much more than Facebook (16 hours) and Instagram (8 hours).

Given the scale of money to be made in the short-form video content segment, advertisers are upping their bets. According to Insider Intelligence, Â US short-form video advertising spending is expected to jump about 10.4% in 2023.

Earlier this year, JPMorgan conducted a survey of investors which shows a positive sentiment for the sector. Despite a gloomy environment in the market and declining ad rates, investors believe the internet sector to âslightlyâ outperform the S&P 500 this year, according to JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. 43% of the respondents in the survey said they believe market-cap weighted internet stocks will be up more than 5% this year, while 30% expect them to be flat. 30% of respondents believe the S&P 500 to be up more than 5% in 2023, while 45% expect flat returns. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was the favorite internet stock of investors according to the survey. Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy

The company is rolling out a new product called Grammarly Business, using generative AI to streamline corporate communications. Among its features, the software can summarize key points in a long email string, identify whether the information is already shared within the organization and compose a reply, Grammarly said Tuesday at an event introducing the product. The tool can connect to other common office applications such as Slack and Gmail, identify priority tasks for employees and compose a response to colleagues across different messaging apps.

âWeâve been helping our users with AI to communicate more effectively for over a decade, now itâs time to go beyond words,â Grammarly Chief Executive Officer Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said at the event.

The first features for Grammarly Business will be available for customers to test in June, with additional functionality added over time, according to the company.

The move is part of San Francisco-based Grammarlyâs effort to ride the generative AI wave and pivot from a grammar-and-spelling checker used by the education industry to a corporate communications and workflow tool. Generative AI uses huge amounts of data to produce text or images in response to a prompt. Grammarlyâs software will face fierce competition from big technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Microsoft Corp., which are adding artificial intelligence features to their popular office products.

Roy-Chowdhury, who became CEO two months ago after serving as head of product, started at Grammarly after 14 years at Google working on products including Chrome browser. He said Grammarly Business will help customers connect all the fragmented apps they use for recruiting, human resources software, messaging and email.

Story continues

âIf a business wants to truly benefit from generative AI, it should be integrated across all applications used by employees,â he said. âParticularly as people write across various platforms and applications, being present where they are can allow for constant learning and automation of workflows and will ultimately save time and promote creativity.â

Google and Microsoft already have announced similar offerings. In March, Google said it will integrate generative AI tools into its Workspace suite including Gmail, Docs, Slides and Sheets. Microsoft also introduced an AI assistant â called Dynamics 365 Copilot â for applications that handle tasks such as sales, marketing and customer service. Based on technology from OpenAI, the software can draft contextual chat and email answers to customer service queries, help marketers come up with client categories to target and write product listings for e-commerce.

Grammarly, which has 30 million daily active users, recently launched GrammarlyGO, a generative AI feature that let users brainstorm ideas, write, edit and personalize text. Using technology from Microsoft and OpenAI, the tool also reviews writing for bias and can fine-tune the style for users by clicking on prompt tabs like âmake it persuasive,â âmake it assertiveâ and âsound confident.â

Roy-Chowdhury said generative AI technology is changing rapidly. âIâm happy to see how it evolves and weâll always find the best technical solutions to help our users,â he said.

567,2023-05-11T10:50:00+00:00,Elon Musk has regrets about ChatGPT. He says heâs a âhuge idiotâ for letting go of OpenAI.,"Elon Musk doesnât express regret a lot, publicly standing by his money-sucking tweets that have been called dated plagiarism and cringey at best and antisemitic and hateful (if not slanderous) at worst. The former CEO of Twitter and Tesla CEO hasnât even admitted to feeling any shame about dressing up as Wario in a courtroom. But in a news-making blockbuster interview with CNBC that aired last night, Musk confessed to several mistakes, and some big ones with his role in forming the company that became OpenAI, the originator of the game-changing ChatGPT artificial intelligence technology.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

A co-founder at OpenAI, Musk resigned from the board in 2018, only to see ChatGPT become the technology with the fastest adoption rate, well, maybe ever. Musk was focused on his own inventions, the self-driving car and humanoid robot thingy which still appears to be mostly robot, Musk has gotten sidetracked in the last year by Twitter, a $44 billion gift to himself. Running Twitter has proven to be more work than simply fun, as serial tweeter Musk admits he might have overpaid by more than $20 billion as the company depreciates in value under his reign.

The grass is always greener on the other side of Silicon Valley, but in Muskâs case, by backing out of OpenAI heâs lost out on quite a bit of money, along with an association with the hottest thing in tech these days. In his interview with CNBCâs David Faber, Musk did what he likes to do best and shared more of his thoughts, this time regarding his choices at OpenAI, what he revealed is a former friendship with Google's Larry Page, and claims that his role in OpenAIâs success was pivotal.

âI fully admit to being a huge idiot here,â Musk says, when asked whether he should have a larger stake in OpenAI given that he invested so much in the project. Musk said he underestimated the potential of the companyâs profitability, but he argued this was unforeseen. After all, the company transitioned from nonprofit to for-profit in 2019, not long after Musk left, and this also gets to the root of his beef with Page.

Story continues

âI am the reason OpenAI exists,â Musk insisted, adding that he poured roughly $50 million into the group, while lamenting, âman, fate loves irony next level.â âIt wouldnât exist without me,â he continued, telling Faber that he came up with the name and recruited key scientists and engineers such as Ilya Sutskever, OpenAIâs co-founder and chief scientist.

Elon and Larry, the real story, according to Elon

The Tesla founder explained that he didnâtâand still doesnâtâbelieve that companies should profit off of A.I. (notwithstanding Tesla vehiclesâ A.I.-like qualities). He describes his fallout with Larry Page as related to this: âI would be constantly urging him to be careful about the danger of A.I., and he was really not concerned about the danger of A.I. He was quite cavalier about it.â Adding to their falling out, Musk describes Page's lobbed accusation that Musk was a speciesist, or believed that AI wasnât as good as humans. Though musk calls it the âlast strawâ he also doesnât seem to mind the label.

Musk said he was spurred to make his open source and therefore the opposite of Pageâs DeepMind initiative at Google, and made sure that OpenAI would be a nonprofit. âThe intent was: âWhatâs the opposite of Google,â [it] would be an opensource nonprofit. Because Google is closed source, for-profit. And that profit motivation can be potentially dangerous.â

Part of Muskâs underestimation comes from thinking OpenAI couldnât wage war against Google. âIn the beginning I thought, âLook, this is probably a hopeless endeavor, how could OpenAI possibly compete with Google Deepmind?â This seemed like an ant against an elephant, not a contest.â

Heâs still sore about how it went down, asking rhetorically if it should be legal for a nonprofit to take IP developed for that purpose and transfer it to a for-profit company, as OpenAI has done. It does âseem weirdâ to him, likening its transformation to funding an organization that claims to save the Amazon rainforest and then finding out that it becomes a lumber company which profits off selling its materials instead.

âYouâd be like âOh, wait a second, thatâs the exact opposite of what I gave the money for, is that legal? That doesnât seem legal.ââ Musk expresses heâs wary of anyone profiting off of A.I. âI do worry that Microsoft actually may be more in control than say the leadership team at OpenAI realizes,â he adds. Whether it be Microsoft or OpenAI leadership running the now very profitable show, one thing is certain, Musk is in the audience at this point.

Wednesday, May 17, 2023

Sens. want to regulate AI before it gets too big. They're running out of time.

If the senators gathered for the Senate Judiciary Committeeâs hearing on AI on Tuesday seem to agree on one thing, itâs that they donât want to miss the opportunity to regulate AI like they did social media.

Throughout the hearing, which included testimony by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, IBM (IBM) Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery, and NYU professor Gary Marcus, senators repeatedly pointed to Congressâ failure to regulate social media or pass any kind of meaningful data privacy legislation.

The gist of the legislatorsâ warnings came down to the potential for AI being used to influence consumers, generate disinformation, or reinforce bias.

âWe had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment,â Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. âNow we have the obligation to do it on AI before the threats and risks become real.â

Fears that AI will be misused

During the hearing, Altman, Montgomery, and Marcus each told the gathered senators that Congress should put at least some kind legislation into place to govern the use of AI. Altman and Marcus in particular called for a new regulatory body that could provide the appropriate licenses for companies to deploy different types of AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Without those, the witnesses said, AI could present its own unique set of problems.

âFundamentally, these new systems are going to be destabilizing,â Marcus said in his opening testimony. âThey can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity's never seen before. Outsiders will use them to affect our elections. Insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems. Democracy itself is threatened.â

Altman, for his part, said he has his own set of fears about AI. âI think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong,â he said. âAnd we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.â

Story continues

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), meanwhile, questioned whether AI could be used to influence public opinion.

Calls for social media regulation but no action

For years members of Congress have called for stricter regulations over social media content.

Politicians have called for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to be stripped or depleted of their Section 230 protections. Others have pushed for the establishment of comprehensive data privacy legislation to protect usersâ online information.

Thereâs a handful of reasons social media has avoided regulations, including a lack of consensus on just how to do it. Section 230, which serves as the backbone of the modern internet, is a frequent target of both Democrats and Republicans. But neither side can agree on why. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing on February 7, 2023. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP)

Democrats say they want to hold sites accountable for what their users post, especially when it comes to disinformation, while Republicans say they want to go after sites for over-moderating content.

Privacy regulation, meanwhile, has been in the works for years, but here we are in 2023 and thereâs no true national data privacy law.

Thereâs potential

While Congress hasnât been able to pull anything together with regards to social media or privacy, it looks as though there might be hope for AI regulation.

In addition to Altman and Montgomery calling for regulation, senators were largely open to ideas about how to deploy AI responsibly. And unlike hearings about social media when lawmakers have been hostile to witnesses such as Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg or former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the senators were generally calm and thoughtful in their comments.

Still, itâll likely be some time before any kind of regulation sees the light of day. Blumenthal himself said that Tuesdayâs hearing was the first of a number to come. But with the pace at which AI is advancing, that could be too long for Congress to wait.

Former Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt is among those raising concerns and is scheduled to testify in a House hearing about China Wednesday as head of an initiative thatâs focused on speeding the US defense establishmentâs adoption of AI. Schmidtâs Special Competitive Studies Project argues in a new report this month that the US needs to redesign its military to respond to the threat.

âChina continues to amass a wide array of advanced capabilities designed specifically to counter the traditional American way of warfighting,â according to the report. It describes a 30-year effort by China to study US combat operations with the aim of being able to puncture its military might, now with the help of AI. It argues that a militaryâs ability to use AI faster than its enemy will be key to its strength.

Ylber Bajraktari, one of the reportâs authors, told Bloomberg News itâs aimed at conveying to the Defense Department, Congress and the public the urgency of accelerating efforts to develop an AI-enabled US military force. But such efforts have sparked concerns of an AI arms race that could ultimately aggravate any conflict between the US and China.

Some US tech titans, including Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, have called for a pause in developing artificial intelligence for military use over growing ethical concerns about its dangerous potential, even though US military leaders have pledged to stop short of letting autonomous weapons choose human targets on their own. Thatâs in keeping with growing concern over civilian uses of AI, including from some of the tech executives developing new products that can both provide cogent answers to questions and spread disinformation and deep-fake imagery.

When Altman Went to Washington and Asked for AI Rules: Takeaways

Still, many officials at the Pentagon and in Congress argue that if the US doesnât develop powerful AI-powered weapons quickly, it will risk losing a potential future conflict with China.

US defense officials have eyed Chinaâs ambitions in artificial intelligence especially warily since 2017, when China revealed its plan to become the global leader by 2030. In 2019, China rolled out a new military concept to bake AI into every part of its warfare operations. The Pentagon started its own efforts to develop and deploy AI for battle scenarios in 2017.

US defense experts worry about the potential crossing of red lines â such as AI-enabled attacks against satellites in space and nuclear architecture â and that the risk of rapid escalation remains underexplored by the US and China given the current climate of hostility.

Gregory Allen, who left his job as director of strategy and policy at the Pentagonâs Joint Artificial Intelligence Center last year, where his role included efforts to accelerate the US militaryâs adoption of AI, recalled multiple attempts by US defense officials to hold what he calls âmilitary AI risk-reduction dialoguesâ with Chinese counterparts. Not a single outreach worked, he said.

âChina has refused all overtures for conversations on military AI,â Allen said of the breakdown in military diplomacy between the two countries. âThatâs a really tragic situation.â

The Chinese embassy in Washington didnât respond to a request for comment.

Trying to rein in Chinaâs AI ambitions, the Biden administration imposed export controls in October intended to prevent the sale of high-end chips to entities operating in China, including the military. The White House is also working on a measure to require a review of outbound investment in certain industries, especially emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing. The Defense Department has asked for $1.8 billion for AI in the 2024 budget, an increase from past years.

Kathleen Hicks, deputy defense secretary, said in a statement that such funding âwill probably grow over time as we incorporate the technology effectively into how we operate.â

âArtificial intelligence is one of the vanguard technologies of our time, so of course we see the PRC trying to advance and exploit it,â she said. She added that the Defense Department is âmaking sure America continues to come out aheadâ by embedding AI in many more aspects of its mission, including battlespace awareness, cyber, reconnaissance, logistics and force support. She said the US is committed to its responsible use.

âFeebleâ Commitments

Such ambitions for â and investment in â autonomous warfare alarms United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and civil society groups such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, an influential coalition of more than 180 member organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The coalition argues for a new international law on autonomy in weapons systems and decries US ethics commitments on responsible military use of AI thus far as âfeeble.â

Not everyone is as sure as Hicks that the US is ahead in the military AI race. Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told Bloomberg the US is âneck-and-neckâ with China on AI, which he described as a critical technology that could determine geopolitical dominance this century. He wants to cut off the flow of American capital to Chinese AI companies.

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank focused on national security, declared in March that China was ahead in 37 of 44 critical technologies, including artificial intelligence. While it deemed the US ahead in natural language processing, it found China is leading on AI algorithms and machine learning, including neural networks and deep learning.

Amid intense rivalry, some in Silicon Valley disapprove of the language of an AI âarms race.â Sarah Shoker, a research scientist who leads OpenAIâs geopolitics policy research team, told a summit on modern conflict at Vanderbilt University this month that she worries the term erroneously conflates economic competition with defense and international security and could cause panic and fear-mongering.

Bajraktari argues that fears about military use of AI are prescient. However, he said competition with China âis not going away.â

âItâs going to be enduring, itâs going to be exhausting, and likely existential,â he said.

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - Montana Governor Greg Gianforte on Wednesday signed legislation to ban the Chinese-owned TikTok from operating in the state, making it the first U.S. state to ban the popular short video app.

Montana will make it unlawful for Google and Apple's app stores to offer the TikTok app within its borders. The ban takes effect Jan. 1, 2024.

TikTok, which has over 150 million American users, is facing growing calls from U.S. lawmakers and state officials to ban the app nationwide over concerns about potential Chinese government influence over the platform.

In March, a congressional committee grilled TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew about whether the Chinese government could access user data or influence what Americans see on the app.

Gov. Gianforte, a Republican, said the bill will further ""our shared priority to protect Montanans from Chinese Communist Party surveillance.""

TikTok, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, said in a statement the bill ""infringes on the First Amendment rights of the people of Montana by unlawfully banning TikTok,"" adding that they ""will defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana.""

The company has previously denied that it has ever shared data with the Chinese government and has said the company would not do so if asked.

Montana, which has a population of just over 1 million people, said TikTok could face fines for each violation and additional fines $10,000 per day if they violate the ban. It takes effect Jan. 1, 2024.

The short video app can be downloaded in app stores on Apple Inc and Google devices. Google is a unit of Alphabet Inc. Apple and Google could also face fines of $10,000 per violation, per day if they violate the ban.

The ban will likely face numerous legal challenges that it violates the First Amendment free speech rights of users. An attempt by then President Donald Trump to ban new downloads of TikTok and WeChat through a Commerce Department order in 2020 was blocked by multiple courts and never took effect.

Story continues

TikTok's free speech allies include several Democratic members of Congress including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and First Amendment groups like the American Civil Liberties Union.

Gianforte also prohibited the use of all social media applications that collect and provide personal information or data to foreign adversaries on government-issued devices.

TikTok is working on an initiative called Project Texas, which creates a standalone entity to store American user data in the U.S. on servers operated by U.S. tech company Oracle. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

Thatâs the view of Zehrid Osmani, manager of Franklin Templetonâs $158 million FTGF Martin Currie Global Long-Term Unconstrained Fund, which is beating 96% of peers in 2023 with returns of about 15% versus an 8% gain in the MSCI All-Country World Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia, one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI-related demand, Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding NV and Microsoft Corp. rank among the fundâs biggest holdings.

While Osmani is overweight the tech sector as a whole, heâs notably staying away from Apple, Alphabet, Facebook-owner Meta and Netflix Inc. as theyâre more directly exposed to the consumer, the fund manager said in an interview in London. They also score poorly on the fundâs fundamental metrics scale, which includes themes such as infrastructure, green and alternative energy and electric transportation.

âTech is still attractive as we think the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates, although we donât expect rate cuts,â Osmani said. âBut you have to look at it through different segments rather than invest across Big Tech.â

The fund manager is among a chorus of market participants bullish on AI-related stocks. An analysis by Societe Generale SA strategists found that, without the hype around AI, the S&P 500 index would be lower this year instead of having gained 8%. The team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said AI-related shares now offer the biggest potential long-term support for US profit margins.

Banks Unattractive

Osmani is also staying away from banks globally, despite cheaper valuations. The sudden collapse of a slate of US regional banks since March has roiled the sector and prompted investors to slash allocation to financials at a pace not seen since before the global financial crisis, according to Bank of America Corp.âs latest global fund manager survey.

âBanking is an industry that has high competitive pressures, diminishing barriers to entry, low pricing power and is facing a higher risk of disruption,â Osmani said. âAll of which leads us to believe that the industry dynamics arenât attractive.â

Acting in a case involving Google, the court refused to limit the immunity internet companies have enjoyed under a decades-old law known as Section 230. In a related case, the court tossed out a lawsuit that said social media companies bore responsibility under an anti-terrorism law for a 2017 shooting in an Istanbul nightclub.

The unanimous decisions together mark a triumph for social media platforms, assuaging fears that the tech industry might face a new deluge of lawsuits and remove speech across their platforms. At least for the time being, the outcome means it would take an act of Congress to broadly open social media companies to lawsuits over third-party content.

The ruling in the Istanbul case put new limits on lawsuits under the US Anti-Terrorism Act. The family of victim Nawras Alassaf claimed that three social media companies âaided and abettedâ the Islamic State because they didnât do enough to remove videos.

Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said any connection between the companies and the nightclub attack was âfar removed.â

âThe allegations plaintiffs make here are not the type of pervasive, systemic, and culpable assistance to a series of terrorist activities that could be described as aiding and abetting each terrorist act by ISIS,â Thomas wrote.

Thomas cast doubt on efforts to hold social media companies liable for algorithms that push content to users.

Story continues

âThe algorithms appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any content (including ISISâ content) with any user who is more likely to view that content,â he wrote. âThe fact that these algorithms matched some ISIS content with some users thus does not convert defendantsâ passive assistance into active abetting.â

Google Reassured

Google hailed the decisions. âCountless companies, scholars, content creators and civil society organizations who joined with us in this case will be reassured by this result,â Google General Counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said.

The Section 230 case involved Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old US citizen who was one of 130 people killed in attacks by the Islamic State group in Paris in November 2015. Her family said Alphabet Inc.âs Google, through its algorithm-driven YouTube recommendations, aided the assailants in violation of the Antiterrorism Act.

In an unsigned opinion, the court said that, because the allegations were âmaterially identicalâ to those in the Istanbul case, the justices didnât need to consider the scope of Section 230 immunity.

âWe therefore decline to address the application of Section 230 to a complaint that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief,â the court said.

The ruling set aside a federal appeals court decision that had let the suit go forward. The justices left open the possibility that Gonzalezâs family could amend the lawsuit.

Tech companies and their allies said weakening Section 230 would have had disastrous effects, forcing social media platforms, search engines and online marketplaces to radically reconfigure their businesses to protect themselves. Critics of the industry called those worries overblown, saying internet companies need to bear more responsibility for the proliferation of dangerous hate speech and disinformation.

Enacted as part of a broader 1996 law, Section 230 is widely credited with helping the internet flourish, giving platforms assurance that they wouldnât be at risk of lawsuits for things their users post.

But the provision has drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Conservatives including former President Donald Trump complain Section 230 shields tech companies that censor right-wing voices, while many liberals say it lets platforms ignore hate speech and extremism.

The cases are Gonzalez v. Google, 21-1333, and Twitter v. Taamneh, 21-1496.

(Reuters) - Google will pay Washington state $39.9 million to resolve a lawsuit accusing the Alphabet Inc unit of misleading consumers about its location tracking practices, state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said on Thursday.

The settlement resolves claims that Google deceived people into believing they controlled how the search and advertising company collected and used their personal data.

In reality, the state said Google was able to collect and profit from that data even if consumers disabled its tracking technology on their smartphones and computers, invading consumers' privacy.

A consent decree filed on Wednesday in King County Superior Court requires Google to be more transparent about its tracking practices, and provide a more detailed ""Location Technologies"" webpage describing them.

""Today's resolution holds one of the most powerful corporations accountable for its unethical and unlawful tactics,"" Ferguson said in a statement.

Google, based in Mountain View, California, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

In November, Google agreed to pay $391.5 million to resolve similar allegations by 40 U.S. states.

Some states including Washington chose to sue Google on their own about its tracking practices. Arizona reached an $85 million settlement with Google last October in one of those cases.

The software, which is free, is now available in the US for iOS devices through Apple Inc.âs App Store. With it, users can type questions and receive responses from the chatbot. It also includes voice recognition so users will be able to speak their queries, according to a Thursday blog post from the Palo Alto, California-based startup. The bot will only respond in writing, however. The app also syncs text-based conversations across various devices.

Users who pay for OpenAIâs ChatGPT Plus subscription can also use its most powerful large language model, GPT-4, via the app, the company said. OpenAI plans to offer its app in more countries in the coming weeks and expects to roll out the Android version soon.

Since its release on the web late last year, millions of people have experimented with ChatGPT and other bots â such as Bard, created by Alphabet Inc.âs Google. This new wave of chatbots are built atop LLMs, the AI models trained on huge swaths of internet data so that they can predict and generate humanlike responses to user prompts. ChatGPT and its ilk are already being harnessed for everything from writing birthday greetings to coding, but they are also prone to exhibiting biases and fabricating believable fiction.

The release of the iOS app may put ChatGPT at many more peopleâs fingertips than the web-based version of the chatbot. It could also subject OpenAI more directly to consumer scrutiny via reviews that users can post in the App Store for others to see.

âWeâre eager to see how you use the app,â the company said in its blog post. âAs we gather user feedback, weâre committed to continuous feature and safety improvements for ChatGPT.â

590,2023-05-10T20:02:30+00:00,Social media firms score Supreme Court win in case that could have changed the web,"Internet platforms notched a major Supreme Court victory Thursday when the high court's justices unanimously decided a case that could have rewritten the rules of the web. The court also sent a parallel case back to a lower court.

Both cases had to do with whether social media companies could be held liable for hosting and promoting terrorist content on their platforms.

Both cases, Twitter v. Taamenehand Gonzalez v. Google, challenged Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that broadly insulates social media platforms, including major platforms like Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) YouTube, Facebook and Instagram (META), and Twitter from legal liability when they show, recommend, and promote content posted by their users.

""Defendantsâ mere creation of their media platforms is no more culpable than the creation of email, cell phones, or the internet generally,""the court stated in its opinion in the Taameneh case. In characterizing the company's algorithms as ""agnostic"" to the nature of hosted content, the justices reasoned that they could not impose liability on YouTube for knowingly aiding and abetting terrorism. WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 21: (L-R) Jose Hernandez and Beatriz Gonzalez, stepfather and mother of Nohemi Gonzalez, who died in a terrorist attack in Paris in 2015, arrive to speak to the press outside of the U.S. Supreme Court following oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google February 21, 2023 in Washington, DC. Oral arguments took place today in Gonzalez v. Google, a landmark case about whether technology companies should be liable for harmful content their algorithms promote. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

Separately, in the Gonzalez opinion, the court sidestepped questions concerning YouTube's Section 230 liability and sent the case back to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case in light of the Taameneh ruling. The court, however, noted its position that the plaintiffs' claims that Twitter aided and abetted terrorism would likely fail.

Anna Diakun, an attorney for the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said, ""The Court correctly recognized in Taamneh that the platforms' alleged conduct was too attenuated and passive to rise to the level of aiding and abetting.""

Although the attack that prompted the suit was terrible and tragic, Diakun said, imposing liability on the platforms in these circumstances would have had far-reaching implications for free speech online. Still, Diakun expects that the court will eventually have to answer important questions that it avoided in todayâs opinions.

Story continues

""Questions about the scope of platformsâ immunity under Section 230 are consequential and will certainly come up soon in other cases,"" she said.

The claims in the two cases arose from separate ISIS terrorist attacks and were brought by victims of the attacks. The plaintiffs in Gonzalez claimed that YouTube caused injuries sustained in an attack because the platform aided and abetted terrorism by knowingly sharing and promoting ISIS content.

In the Taamneh case, the plaintiffs argued that Facebook, Twitter, and Google should be held liable for providing material aid to ISIS terrorists.

According to the plaintiffs, the companies should be stripped of Section 230 immunity because they failed to block the allegedly harmful posts.

In the Taamneh decision, the court went on to say that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the platforms here do more than ""transmit information by billions of peopleâmost of whom use the platforms for interactions that once took place via mail, on the phone, or in public areas...""

In Gonzalez, family members and the estate of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old US citizen killed in a December 2015 ISIS shooting at La Belle Equipe bistro in Paris, argued that Google should be held at least partially liable for her death. They alleged the company's YouTube service knowingly permitted and recommended, via algorithms, inflammatory ISIS-created videos that allegedly played a key role in recruiting the attackers.

In their arguments, plaintiffs claimed that YouTube's act of creating thumbnails â images that appear in internet search results as representations of available third-party content â converted the company from a passive host of third-party content into a recommender of content, more akin to publishers or speakers that are not covered by Section 230's liability shield.

But the court found that the plaintiffs' arguments didn't mean YouTube was liable for the attack.

Google's lawyer Lisa Blatt objected, arguing that for content providers, there's no way around making choices to organize and provide search results to their users.

Before the Supreme Court took up the Gonzalez case, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the lawsuit at Google's request, concluding that Section 230 barred the claims because ISIS, not Google, created the videos. Meanwhile, judges in separate jurisdictions, faced with similar claims, applied varying interpretations to Section 230's liability shield.

The US Supreme Court has kicked out a lawsuit aiming to make Google and Twitter liable for videos endorsing the Islamic State terror group, ending a legal battle that could have transformed the rules governing the internet.

Top judges dismissed a case brought by relatives of a terror attack victim who claimed that one of the worldâs biggest tech companies was aiding and abetting Isis by funnelling advertising revenue to it.

The court said:Â âThe fact that some bad actors took advantage of these platforms is insufficient to state a claim that defendants knowingly gave substantial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those wrongdoers' acts.â

The decision, which stretches across two separate but very similar cases brought against Google and Twitter, upholds a controversial shield law for US tech companies called Section 230.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act says websites cannot be held liable for content uploaded by their users.

Critics have said the actâs protections are too broad and protect obviously illicit content from takedowns. Free speech advocates say it is wrong to hold platforms liable for postings made by third parties.

US courts have previously interpreted Section 230 broadly, holding that it also protects automatic recommendations made by social media algorithms.

In Thursdayâs decision, the family of Nohemi Gonzalez, a US citizen killed by terrorists, was suing Google by claiming the Big Tech company had hosted Isis propaganda videos and shared advertising proceeds with the organisation through YouTubeâs revenue sharing system.

The 23-year-old design student was murdered in a Paris attack in 2015.

Summarising Miss Gonzalezâs familyâs case, the Supreme Court said: âAll of their claims broadly centre on the use of YouTube, which Google owns and operates, by Isis and Isis supporters.""

In dismissing the case, judges referred to a near-identical lawsuit brought against Twitter which was also thrown out on Thursday, saying it was too tangential to proceed.

They added: âWe therefore decline to address the application of Section 230 that appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief.â

Democrat senator Mark Warner of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this year which he said would force social media companies to take liability for âharmful scams, harassment and violent extremism that runs rampant across their platformsâ.

After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.

The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.

So, what would happen to the economy if America were to default? Well, the government borrows money to fund a variety of programs and functions such as salaries and healthcare spending. This funnels money into the economy and stimulates productivity for a variety of businesses. In case of a default, this spending stops and a large amount of money is removed from the economy. How large? According to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the event can cut up to ten percent of the American economy until the government figures out how to raise money. Perhaps ironically, a default also increases the risk premium that investors lending to the U.S. government demand for their money, which then spirals into higher costs of borrowing for the consumer (for instance for mortgages) and more interest payments that the government has to make on its debt. In broader terms, a Democratic Party think tank estimates that the economy can lose as many as three million jobs and a 30 year mortgage could cost an additional $130,000 to fund.

In this turmoil, how does one invest? Well, it's important to look at what hedge funds are doing especially since talk of the debt ceiling had started to emerge since January. Fortunately for us, hedge fund filings for the first quarter of this year have started to become available and one fund that is on our radar is billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Mr. Tepper is one of the richest people in the world, with Forbes Magazine estimating his net worth at $18.5 billion as of May 2023. He set up the hedge fund in 1993 and since then it has grown to manage billions of dollars in funds, with our research suggesting a portfolio value of $1.8 billion as of Q1 2023. The billionaire has a business school named after him, and he started his career working in a steel company. Mr. Tepper's astute management at Goldman Sachs during the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash earned him laurels in the industry, as he bought debt that had dropped in value at the time but then recuperated the losses after the market recovered - resulting in gains for the investment bank.

Today, we'll look at Mr. Tepper's top stock picks as the clouds of recession remain on the horizon and lawmakers wonder if a default will really be that bad. Some top picks of the billionaire are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER).

596,2023-05-10T19:25:13+00:00,Explainer-How Montana could enforce a TikTok ban,"(Reuters) - Montana took the unusual step on Wednesday of banning Chinese-owned short video app TikTok, with lawmakers of the sparsely populated western U.S. state saying they aimed to protect residents from alleged intelligence gathering by China.

TikTok, which is wildly popular with American teens and owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, is already banned on government-issued devices in around 30 U.S. states and for employees of the country's federal agencies.

While blocking apps by geography is not unheard of, the Montana law is notable for doing so at the state level, upending a single-market approach Apple and Alphabet's Google have long been able to use for their U.S. app stores.

Montana's ban is set to take effect on Jan. 1 2024.

HAS THIS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE?

Sort of.

Tech companies are now well-practiced in blocking apps at the country level, mostly to comply with U.S. sanctions or for business purposes, like Apple's blocking of messaging and privacy apps in China upon government request.

Enterprising young people in affected countries have an equally long track record of skirting the bans by downloading the apps while traveling internationally or using tools like virtual private networks (VPNs), which obscure their location.

Within the United States, Pornhub recently disabled its services for IP addresses in Utah ahead of a state law that came into effect requiring adult content platforms to verify users' ages. However, that involved a website only, not an app.

Specifically for apps, Google and Apple appear to have navigated a tangle of different U.S. state rules around online gambling by leaving compliance to individual app developers, according to their app store guidance.

Google only started allowing gambling apps in its U.S. app store as of 2021, prior to which it restricted the apps in all but four countries: Brazil, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Apple and Google declined to comment on how they approach state rules on gambling.

Story continues

IS A STATE-LEVEL BAN EVEN TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE?

While TikTok can theoretically block IP addresses registered in Montana, app stores will have a more difficult time.

Apple and Google declined comment on the technical aspects of implementing a ban, but TechNet, a trade group funded by both companies, told Montana lawmakers in March that app stores ""do not have the ability to geofence on a state-by-state basis.""

""It would thus be impossible for our members to prevent the app from being downloaded specifically in the state of Montana,"" the TechNet representative testified.

According to cybersecurity researchers, that is likely because companies organize their app stores at the country level, meaning they have systems for shutting off downloads of a given app in some countries while keeping it accessible elsewhere.

The companies do not appear to have built such controls at a more granular level, the researchers said.

""I think it's possible but it's not possible today. It would require a bunch of code to be written,"" Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and former top security officer at Facebook, said in a recent podcast.

The app stores also would need to monitor more detailed location data from users' phones than they currently use, infringing on users' privacy, Stamos said.

Even if the companies were to make those changes, TikTok-obsessed teens in Montana are likely to follow their peers around the world in learning how to use privacy tools and road trips to get the app onto their phones, said another researcher, John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab.

""The youth of Montana are about to become America's experts in VPNs,"" Railton said.

597,2023-05-10T19:08:28+00:00,The Professor Who Made $10 Billion By Cutting Google Its First Startup Check,"In the realm of hitting the jackpot, being in the right place at the right time and taking a gamble can prove life-changing. One person who embodies this serendipitous combination is Stanford University professor David Cheriton.

Donât Miss: Why Jason Calacanis and Other Silicon Valley Elites Are Betting On This Startups Vision For Re-Uniting American Families

While his name may not ring a bell for most, Cheriton stands as one of the luckiest and wealthiest educators of all time. How did a college professor make $10 billion?

It dates to a fateful moment in 1998 when he wrote a check to two of his students â Larry Page and Sergey Brin â to kick-start their visionary venture. The result? The company that emerged from that modest $100,000 seed money â Google Inc., now Alphabet Inc. This single act transformed the life of a college professor and computer scientist in monumental ways.

Born on March 29, 1951, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Cheriton embarked on his academic journey with studies in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, followed by the University of Alberta. Initially pursuing a dual major in music and mathematics, his path took an unexpected turn when he was denied admission to the music program. Undeterred, he switched gears and completed his degree in mathematics at the University of British Columbia in 1973.

Fueling his intellectual pursuits, he pursued a masterâs and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Waterloo. It was during his tenure at Stanford University, where he held a professorship, that fate intervened with an intriguing opportunity.

While at Stanford, Cheriton spearheaded a team of computer scientists in developing the V operating system, a microkernel operating system that eventually became a cornerstone of the internet protocol (IP) multicast standard and an invaluable tool for graphical user interface research. This operating system, born out of Cheritonâs prior developments Thoth and Verex, found its greatest utility in research-oriented contexts. Throughout his tenure at Stanford, he continued to delve into operating systems and experiment with network communications.

Story continues

In 1996, Cheriton and electrical engineer Andy Bechtolsheim, a Stanford Ph.D. graduate who had already achieved success with Sun Microsystems Inc., co-founded Granite Systems. This network-switching company caught the attention of industry giant Cisco Systems Inc., which acquired it for $220 million.

In 1998, when Cheriton, Bechtolsheim, Brin and Page convened on Cheritonâs front porch, Brin and Page unveiled their brainchild â an audacious project they called Google.

Impressed by their vision, Bechtolsheim swiftly wrote a check for $100,000. Inspired by the studentsâ ambition, Cheriton decided to match the investment, writing his own $100,000 check. Empowered by this initial injection of $200,000, Brin and Page embarked on the development of what would eventually become the immensely successful Google â a name that has even transformed into a verb.

Cheriton's philosophy revolves around thinking big and making a meaningful impact on the world. A plaque on his desk bears the inscription, âDr. David R. Cheriton, Chief Superintendent of Saying Important Things.â He steers clear of chasing fleeting market trends, including social networking, and instead remains focused on pursuing breakthroughs that tangibly enhance human lives. For instance, he values how Google assists college students in completing research papers even in the wee hours of the morning.

Making Your Own Bets

For those not well-connected and connections to invest in the next Google, changes in federal law allow anyone to invest in startups. Platforms like StartEngine have emerged allowing everyday investors to participate in startup funding, including investing in StartEngine itself. StartEngine provides opportunities for ordinary investors to back promising startups and share in the upside if they ultimately conduct an initial public offering, or get bought out.

598,2023-05-10T19:02:25+00:00,Big names in AI to convene at secretive Bilderberg meeting,"Some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence (AI) will participate in this yearâs edition of the secretive Bilderberg Meeting, which routinely attracts business and political elites from around the world.

The annual Bilderberg Meeting begins Thursday and will conclude Sunday in Lisbon, Portugal. Roughly 130 participants from 23 countries are expected to be in attendance and participate in the private event.

Several executives from tech companies involved in the AI arms race will be in attendance, according to Bilderberg, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST NAMES IN TECH DOING ON AI?

Altman testified earlier this week before a Senate committee and invited regulation on AI, saying ""regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models.""

Schmidt, who serves as the co-founder of Schmidt Futures, has struck a similar note, calling the recent advances in AI a ""watershed moment"" and expressing concern that bad actors could abuse the technology.

After COVID-19, 2023 will likely be a gloomier year for technology. Due to geopolitical and economic instability, the next stage of technology growth is being handled with greater caution. Leaders will need to find ways to accomplish more with fewer resources, see opportunities where innovations collide, and choose wisely which technologies to invest in when they approach a tipping point.

Market Outlook

Numerous technological developments that might alter the way we work and live in 2022 have been identified. These included innovations in clean energy technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual reality. The challenge for CEOs in 2023 for top companies such as, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), will be to think about how all these technologies might open up new possibilities when they are utilized together, or what we refer to as combinatorial trends, rather than merely banking on individual trends or ramping up software engineering skills.

Technology advances are crucial to the creation of smart cities. Urban settings may be made more effective, sustainable, and livable with the help of modern technology. Modern data-driven technologies can help address environmental issues, reduce resource consumption, optimize urban infrastructure, and improve the quality of life for city dwellers. Examples include digital water systems, smart grids, digital transportation, data-driven traffic management, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

However, there are challenges that should be considered and addressed, such as how fast urbanization might cause a housing crisis or how a lackluster internet infrastructure can cause sustainability problems. City planners may construct resilient, livable,Â and inclusive cities that successfully handle the issues of overcrowding and mass urban migration while enhancing the general quality of life for urban people by placing a high priority on holistic urban sustainability.

Story continues

The reality of the Metaverse will Change the Way We Work.

The virtual world, or Metaverse, has undergone significant technological growth in recent years. Early estimates suggest that by 2031, the worldwide Metaverse's economic contribution may be worth above $3 trillion. Plans to use the Metaverse are already progressing in places like Seoul, Dubai, and more. New prospects are also emerging in an extensive variety of aspects, including training, remote work, education, and more.

Additionally, the growth of the virtual world might result in a contribution of 1.7%, or $440 billion (â¬417 billion), to the global economy over the course of ten years.

AI will Boost the Technological Trend in the Future

Businesses may take advantage of quick access to data-driven information using AI at the Edge to quickly respond to business demands. Real-time patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare, effective traffic management in smart cities, preventative maintenance on the production line, etc., will all be made possible by AI at the edge. Lenovo's ThinkEdge SE450, for instance, is already reducing business complexity, boosting computational power in remote areas, addressing security concerns, and producing correct insights more quickly.

Soon, AI-enabled Edge servers may examine multiple video feeds from store aisle cameras to look for large amounts of merchandise being removed at once and monitor deliveries to help retailers better manage their inventory and quickly cope with supply and demand, enhancing sales and earnings and ensuring consumers receive in return of their heavy investment. 25 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World

The FTSE 100 and European stocks were higher this Friday, extending rallies on Wall Street fuelled by optimism over talks to avert a catastrophic US debt default.

The FTSE 100 (^FTSE) gained 0.45% to 7,777 points during afternoon trading, while the CAC 40 (^FCHI) in Paris gained 0.86% to 7,510 points. In Germany, blue-chip DAX (^GDAXI) index has climbed 0.8% to set a new record high of 16,293.68 points today.

The FTSE 100 rose as data showed British consumer confidence hit a 15-month high, adding to the optimism that a deal over the US debt ceiling was imminent.

Wall Street's main indexes opened higher amid optimism that a deal to avoid a catastrophic US debt default could be reached over the weekend.

FTSE

London stocks edged higher following a positive close on Wall Street, amid hopes a deal will be reached to avert a US debt default and improved consumer confidence.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""Growing optimism for a resolution to the debt ceiling negotiations lifted sentiment, although the mood was slightly tempered by question marks over the Federal Reserveâs next move on interest rates.

""The mood music from the politicians involved in brokering a deal to raise the debt ceiling and avoid an unthinkable US default was more positive, with investors reacting with cautious optimism until such time as a deal is finalised.""

Miners led the gains across the UK's blue chip index, with Anglo American (AAL.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Glencore (GLEN.L) and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) all up.

Smiths Group (SMIN.L) rallied as it lifted revenue guidance after a strong third quarter, driven by volume and price growth. Organic revenue was up 13.4% for the nine months to 30 April, leading Smiths to increase 2023 guidance to around 10% organic revenue growth with ""moderate"" margin improvement.

BT Group (BT-A.L) rose 2% after Thursdayâs results-day hammering, while Burberry (BRBY.L) slipped 2.60%.

Also driving sentiments across the markets was data suggesting that consumer confidence in the year ahead is continuing to recover despite persistent cost of living pressures.

GfKâs Consumer Confidence Index rose by three points in May to minus 27, the fourth monthly increase in a row from Januaryâs minus 45.

""I see the path that we could come through,â House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Thursday morning. He added: âItâd be important to try to have the agreement, especially in principle, by sometime this weekend.â

The moves higher on Friday morning are an extension of week long gains, primarily led by big tech. On Thursday, Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) all finished at their highest levels in at least a year.

Japanâs core inflation nationwide rose 3.4% year-on-year in April, in line with forecasts by economists polled by Reuters.

Pound

The pound (GBPUSD=X) has not managed to pounce on US debt ceiling optimism as with many G10 currencies as investors remain in the cautiousâ camp, with sterling trading at $1.2414.

Sterling (GBPEUR=X) was muted against the euro, trading at â¬1.1512.

UBS forecast further gains for the pound against the US dollar (USD) while it expects âmore of the sameâ against the euro.

The Swiss bank said sterling has been the best performing G10 currency against the USD this year but feels there is more to come.

âIn our view, more gains are likely over the next 12 months, supported by a still attractive valuation, and a central bank that has recently taken a more hawkish shift.â

Oil markets

Meanwhile, Brent crude (BZ=F) gained ground and was trading at around $76 per barrel with oil prices set to record their first weekly gain since mid-April as sentiment about future demand improves amid signs there may be progress on the debt ceiling negotiations in Congress.

âI think markets have been pricing out the risks of a US debt default, which translates to a more risk-on environment and some dip-buying in Brent crude from previous oversold conditions,â said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG.

Yandex did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Billionaires Vladimir Potanin and Vagit Alekperov bid for at least a 51% controlling stake in Yandex's Russian business, which they value at about 560 billion roubles ($7.21 billion) to 600 billion roubles, the report said citing people familiar with the matter.

The board of Yandex might discuss the bids next week when it meets in Dubai, the report added.

The Kremlin will need to sign off on the final group of buyers, Bloomberg said.

Since Moscow sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022 Yandex, often dubbed ""Russia's Google"", has struggled to balance pressures from Western investors and is also appealing to a Nasdaq plan to delist its stock.

Yandex's primary advertising competitor, Alphabet Inc's Google, stopped selling online advertising in Russia last year.

The company also sold its news aggregator platform Yandex News and content recommendation service Yandex Zen to its Russian rival VK in 2022.

The Royal Free London NHS Trust transferred patient data to Google's artificial intelligence firm DeepMind Technologies in 2015 in relation to the development of a mobile app designed to analyse medical records and detect acute kidney injuries.

Britain's data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, said in 2017 that the Royal Free, which is part of the public National Health Service (NHS), misused patient data when it provided the information to DeepMind.

Alphabet Inc unit Google and DeepMind were sued last year by Royal Free patient Andrew Prismall on behalf of 1.6 million people for alleged misuse of private information.

The companies argued in March that the case is ""bound to fail"" as there was no prospect of establishing that all 1.6 million claimants' private information was misused, or that they had any expectation of privacy in relation to the information.

Judge Heather Williams ruled on Friday that the case should not proceed, agreeing the case is ""bound to fail"".

""I conclude that each member of the claimant class does not have a realistic prospect of establishing a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of their relevant medical records,"" she said in a written ruling.

607,2023-05-10T17:45:00+00:00,8 Best Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Bill Ackman,"In this article, we discuss the 8 best stocks to buy in 2023 according to Bill Ackman. To skip the detailed history of Bill Ackman and his hedge fundâs performance, go directly to the 4 Best Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Bill Ackman.

Bill Ackman manages and owns the New York-based hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, better known as Pershing Square. Ackman received his Bachelors of Arts degree in Social Studies from Harvard in 1988, and in 1992, he completed his MBA from Harvard Business School. As of May 18, he has a net worth of $3.5 billion. Bill Ackman is an activist investor who is known for pressuring The Wendy's Company (NASDAQ:WEN) to spin off Tim Hortons and being involved in a proxy battle with Canadian Pacific Railway.

Story of Ackmanâs Success

Bill Ackman founded Gotham Partners with David P. Berkowitz in 1992. His initial success is owed to a thesis on MBIA Inc. (NYSE:MBI). At the time, MBIA Inc. (NYSE:MBI) was an AAA-rated company and Ackman questioned it. He wrote:

âWere the insurance company downgraded by even one notch (from AAA to AA+), even the company acknowledges its business could be materially impaired. In light of MBIAâs enormous leverage, the companyâs credit quality, underwriting, transparency, accounting, and track record must be beyond reproach. In addition, and as importantly, the company must have minimal liquidity risk. Based on our research, we conclude that MBIA fails to meet these standards.

It appears to us that an actual or perceived downgrade of MBIA would have fairly draconian consequences to the company and create substantial drains on the companyâs liquidity. The self-reinforcing and circular nature of the companyâs exposures make it a poor candidate for a AAA rating.â

Moreover, Ackman placed short bets against the insurer believing that the company will default due to collateral debt obligations exposure, and faced a massive backlash, especially from the CEO of the company. By June 2008, MBIA Inc. (NYSE:MBI) lost its AAA rating, and Ackmanâs firm Pershing Square was able to make $1.1 billion off of it.

Story continues

The Great Financial Crisis proved to be a highly profitable time for Bill Ackman. In 2009, General Growth Properties filed for bankruptcy after its debt reached $27 billion and was unable to refinance it. Pershing Square was one of the firms that helped reorganize the company and in 2011, Ackman told Bloomberg that the effort âturned $60 million into $1.6 billion.â

Pershing Squareâs Performance and Bets

Bill Ackman started Pershing Square Capital Management with $54 million. In the last 10 years, the hedge fundâs portfolio has gained close to 134% and in the last three years, the fundâs annualized average returns are at 12%. Despite the rough economic conditions, Pershing Square has returned 20.81% in the last 12 months according to Tipranks.

Samsung has suspended an internal review that explored replacing Google with Bing on its web-browsing app, which comes pre-installed on the company's smartphones, according to the report.

Google and Samsung did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.

A sizable part of the revenue earned by search-engine companies comes from their long-term partnerships with phone makers such as Apple Inc and Xiaomi.

Google earns an estimated $3 billion in annual revenue from the Samsung contract, according to an April 16 report by the New York Times.

Samsung considering a potential shift to Bing was first reported last month and had weighed on Alphabet's shares at the time.

The integration of OpenAI's artificial intelligence technology into Microsoft-owned Bing has driven people to the little-used search engine and helped it compete better with market leader Google in page visits growth, according to data from analytics firm Similarweb.

611,2023-05-10T16:32:32+00:00,Exclusive-India's govt plans action against Google after antitrust breaches,"By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government plans to take action against Alphabet Inc's Google after an antitrust watchdog last year found the group to have abused its market position by indulging in anti-competitive practices, a top IT minister told Reuters.

India's antitrust body in October fined Google $275 million in two cases, which involved abusing its dominant position in the Android operating system market, and pushing developers to use its in-app payment system.

Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the federal deputy minister for information technology, told Reuters in an interview at the IT ministry in New Delhi that such findings are ""serious"" and cause ""deep concern"" to India's federal government, which will take its own action against Google.

""The ministry has to take action,"" Chandrasekhar said. ""We have thought through it. You will see it in the coming weeks. Certainly it's not something that we will leave and push under the carpet.""

The minister declined to specify what sort of policy or regulatory action the government could take.

Chandrasekhar, who is one of the highest-ranking officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, said the issue ""is worrisome, not just for us, it's worrisome for the entire digital ecosystem in India"".

Google did not respond to a request for comment on the minister's remarks. Asked if he had held talks with Google on the issue, Chandrasekhar said ""there is no need for any discussion. There is a finding of a court.""

While the payments case is still under appeal, an Indian tribunal in March said in response to a legal challenge that the Competition Commission of India's findings of Google's anti-competitive conduct in the Android market were correct.

The comments by the minister come against a backdrop of growing tension between Indian companies and Google.

Story continues

India's competition watchdog has begun another inquiry into Google after Tinder owner Match Group and many startups alleged that a new service fee system Google uses for in-app payments breaches the competition commission's October decision.

Google has previously said the service fee supports investments in the Google Play app store and the Android mobile operating system, ensuring it can distribute it for free.

Following the Android antitrust order in India, Google was also forced make sweeping changes to how it markets its mobile operating system in the country, even though it warned ""no other jurisdiction has ever asked for such far-reaching changes"".

About 97% of India's 620 million smartphones run on Android, and the company counts India as a critical growth market.

Other companies such as Apple and Amazon also face cases against them for potential anti-competitive practices in India. Chandrasekhar said the government was keen to take steps to ensure India's digital economy is protected.

""We donât want it to be growth in a way that distorts consumer choice or free competition,"" he said.

""We will certainly be looking into what the government needs to do to prevent anybody, including but not limited to Google, from abusing their market power or market dominance.""

Samsung suspendedan internal review that had explored replacing Google with Bing on its mobile devices, the Wall Street Journal cites familiar sources. Any reversal would have handed Bing a coveted victory in the Google-led search-engine space. In 2023, Bing got a new lease on life after adopting ChatGPT features run by Microsoft-backedÂ OpenAI. The South Korean smartphone maker initially eyed a search-engine switch since most users opt for other browsers, including Google Chrome, which also comes preinstalled on Samsung phones. Given concerns over market perception and the impact on its wide-ranging business relations with Google, Samsung proposed not to discuss the matter at this time internally. According to Counterpoint Research, Samsung shipped ~260 million smartphones last year, accounting for roughly one-fifth of the worldwide total. Google has served as the default search engine on Samsungâs smartphones since its first modelâthe Galaxy Sâlaunched in 2010. The search engine switch was part of Samsungâs efforts to diversify its smartphone software and consider new offerings. Google maintained lucrative contracts with Samsung andÂ Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) to confirm that Googleâs apps or services as default options on devices sold by the smartphone makers. Microsoft, too, has maintained a close partnership with Samsung. Price Action: GOOG shares traded higher by 0.75% at $124.33 on the last check Friday. Photo via Wikimedia Commons

621,2023-05-10T11:07:00+00:00,Google and Samsung are wasting a golden opportunity with their foldable phones,"Big slabs of glass on the front, chunky camera systems on the back. Smartphones have generally revolved around the same basic design since their inception.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

The closest approximation to a next-generation phone design is the foldable phone: a device that behaves like a normal smartphone and fits in your pocket, but opens like a book to reveal a bigger display when you need it.

It's an obvious advance in form and and function. Unfortunately, foldable phones are simply not attainable for most people.

Some of the wealthiest tech companies in the world, including Samsung, Microsoft, and now Google (as of last week, with its first-generation Pixel Fold) are in this space. But despite vast technical improvements over the last four yearsâSamsung, for instance, has gotten much better at making foldable phones after its rocky startâtheyâre still a status symbol at best.

Itâs not their designs, or their performance. The one major aspect holding back foldable phones is their price.

It's not about margins

The first major foldable smartphone on the scene, Galaxy Fold was priced around $2,000 back in 2019, and unfortunately, not much has changed.

Samsungâs latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 4, costs $1,800. Googleâs Pixel Fold unveiled last week? Also $1,800. To be clear, $1,800 is rent or mortgage for a lot of people.

Sure, foldable phones are based on novel technology and are expensive to make. An independent analysis from Nikkei shows Samsungâs new Galaxy Z Fold 4 contains about $670 in components, which equates to around 38% of the phoneâs sales price. But that leaves 62% of potential gross profit margin (although we don't know Samsung's costs to assemble the devices). As a comparison, Appleâs top-tier iPhone, the 14 Pro Max, costs up to $474 to make, according to Counterpoint Research â which translates to a 58% of potential gross margin for Apple. In other words, Samsung may be making more money from its foldable phones (at least, on a gross-margin basis, which doesn't include marketing costs) than Apple is making from smartphones based on the standard design. These gadgets could be priced lower.

Story continues Rich Osterloh, senior vice president, devices and service for Google, holds a Pixel Fold phone during a Bloomberg Television interview at the Google I/O Developers Conference in Mountain View, California, US, on Wednesday, May 10, 2023. Google introduced a new large language model, used for training artificial intelligence tools like chatbots, known as PaLM 2, and said it has already woven it into many of the internet search company's marquee products.

The lesson of the iPhone

Thereâs an argument to be made that you can make a nice little business with expensive gadgets by aiming them squarely at early adopters and hobbyists. But one thing weâve learned in the smartphone's roughly 16-year history is that new categories of tech products need lower pricing in order to go mainstream.

The very first iPhone cost $499 for 4 GB of storage and $599 for 8 GB â which was a ton of money for a cell phone back in 2007. Getting the sense its price was limiting the market for these phones, Apple tried a new strategy with its second-generation phone, the iPhone 3G, and renegotiated its carrier deal to have AT&T subsidize the upfront cost of the phone (AT&T would recoup most of the losses over the course of a two-year contract). This allowed consumers to buy the iPhone 3G with 8 GB of storage for just $199, and a 16 GB version for $299. As a result, Apple's iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased by more than 1,100% between 2008 and 2015, with the iPhone reigning supreme as the top selling smartphone in the U.S.

Carrier subsidies clearly made a huge difference because for many years, the iPhone struggled in Europe, where many carriers did not subsidize phones. This led to a jump in Android phone adoption in the region because, compared to a $680 iPhone, you could buy an Android phone for under $200.

Apple leaned on carrier subsidies for about a decade â the death of the $199 iPhone came in 2016, where Apple instead let you buy the phone outright or pay for it through a monthly plan. And it wasnât until 2017 when Apple introduced its first $1,000 phone. So raising the price of the iPhone was a gradual effort â and the same should be done for foldables if their makers want them to succeed.

Room to grow

Lower prices for foldable phones could prove to be a huge benefit to a company like Google or Samsung, which for many years have tried to convert customers away from Appleâs walled-garden ecosystem. And Android phones clearly need some help: The rate of Android users switching to iPhone is at a five-year high. Given that Apple doesn't currently offer a foldable phone though, these bending-screened devices could provide a reason for people to stay on Android, or even switch to Android.

For what itâs worth, people are buying foldables, even at these nosebleed-worthy prices. But sales are still a drop in the bucket compared to the total smartphone market.

Why companies arenât pricing foldables lower is hard to know. Perhaps the components necessary to make foldable phones are still limited. If thatâs the case, then lowering the price could be counterproductive, since there would not be enough supply to meet the demand.

Keeping foldable phones in the premium tier could also be important for any number of strategic corporate reasons. But when you consider the history of smartphones, and how they succeeded when they became more affordable, itâs clear that if Google, Samsung, or others want their foldables to win, or at least become widely-used, thereâs one simple solution: Lower the price.

622,2023-05-10T10:21:20+00:00,Why Montana's TikTok ban faces massive challenges,"Montana on Wednesday became the first state in the country to ban TikTok. But experts say you shouldnât expect the measure to survive challenges in the courts.

In addition to the technical difficulties of banning an app in a specific geographic location, the law, SB 419, likely violates Montana residentsâ First Amendment rights.

âThe ban is a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion on the First Amendment rights of Montanans,â Ramya Krishnan, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute and a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School, told Yahoo Finance. âTo justify the ban, Montana would have to show that it's necessary to prevent actual harms. And it hasn't done this.â

The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, 2024, would hold companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) liable if they make TikTok available for download in the state. Each violation would cost the companies $10,000 per user and an additional $10,000 for each day the app remains available.

In a statement after signing the bill, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to, âspy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect personal, private, and sensitive information.â

The broader problem for Montanaâs law, experts say, is that itâs simply too broad.

âThe legal hurdle is the First Amendment,â David Greene, civil liberties director and senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained via email. âThis law, as a restriction on the way Montanans speak and receive speech, will need to be justified by the state as an appropriately narrow and effective way of protecting Montanansâ personal data. That will be very difficult to do.â Banned in Billings: Fans stand near a TikTok logo during the fourth inning of a baseball game in NYC. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)

Vague allegations

The U.S. has long accused TikTok of collecting data on Americans and feeding it to the Chinese government. Reasons include, potentially, building a database on American users, storing data to blackmail citizens, or trying to spread disinformation online.

Story continues

The main fear is that China can use its national intelligence law to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to turn over any data on American users to the Chinese government. TikTok, however, has said it has never shared information with the Chinese government.

To assuage U.S. fears that China can gain access to Americansâ user data, TikTok is working with Oracle (ORCL) to move all U.S. user data to that companyâs servers. The cloud provider will also audit TikTokâs code. But according to Bloomberg, that process is on hold. Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.

Neither the U.S. government nor Montana have provided concrete evidence that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok. And thatâs a major problem for the new law. âSpeculative harms can't justify a total ban on a communications platform, let alone one that is used by...Americans in the state of Montana,â said Krishnan.

Even enforcing the ban could prove problematic for Montana. If the state chooses to determine residentsâ locations based on their internet protocol addresses, they could accidentally block citizens of bordering states from downloading TikTok, as well. Montanans could also use virtual private networks to mask their location and download the app anyway.

A privacy law?

Rather than outright banning TikTok, experts say the best way to address concerns that the company is harvesting Americansâ data is through a national data privacy law. Congress has discussed the topic for years without passing any legislation.

âFirst look at passing a federal privacy lawâ¦to ensure that there are specific limits and rules for the road of how any online service, TikTok included, can collect and use and share people's personal information,â Emma LlansÃ³, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project told Yahoo Finance.

âThat would be an enormous step forward for people's privacy, and would not require banning any apps whatsoever.â

According to LlansÃ³, the government could also put restrictions on how data brokers in the U.S. share Americansâ information.

âThey could put limits on that or put a stop to that, and that would be a much more meaningful way to protect the safety and security of people's data from foreign government surveillance,â she explained.

Regardless, we wonât have to wait long to find out how Montanaâs ban will fare in the courts. According to Reuters, a group of five Montana TikTok users are already suing the state to block the ban.

623,2023-05-10T10:00:00+00:00,'We Are Going Up': New York Mets Owner Steve Cohen Identifies 'Big Wave' Of Opportunities In This Segment. Here's How He's Positioning His Bets,"Heightened interest rates have cast a shadow of doubt over stock market optimism, intensifying concerns of a looming economic downturn. Many experts have called for a recession.

But billionaire hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen is taking a bullish stance.

âIâm making a prognostication â weâre going up,â he said at a private conference, according to Bloomberg.

Cohen knows a thing or two about navigating the markets and rising to the top. After all, the hedge fund managerâs career inspired the character Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis in the TV show âBillions.â

Noting that heâs âactually pretty bullish,â Cohen highlighted one specific segment in todayâs market: artificial intelligence (AI).

He warned that if investors become overly preoccupied with recession concerns, they might miss the âbig waveâ of opportunities in AI.

The billionaire investor is putting his money where his mouth is. According to the latest Form 13F filing of his firm Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has placed quite a few bets in the AI arena. Hereâs a look at three notable ones.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

As the parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc. was created in 2015 to give Googleâs wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.

Commanding a market cap of over $1.5 trillion, Alphabet is a tech behemoth. But the stock can still be volatile. Shares plunged 39% in 2022 but have surged 37% so far in 2023.

Some consider the increasing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT a threat to Alphabet's business. But Alphabet is not standing still, as the company is also advancing its own AI products.

Story continues

âIn March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard,â Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings conference call last month. âWe've since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation.â

As of March 31, Cohenâs firm owned 3.31 million shares of Alphabet, worth $343.01 million at the time.

Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA)

Point72 Asset Management also held 980,638 shares of Nvidia, valued at $272.39 million at the end of March.

Known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia stock has been on a tear.

Year to date, shares have shot up 120%.

The rise of AI may have something to do with investor enthusiasm for the chipmaker.

In an earnings release in February, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that AI âis at an inflection point.â

And that could present a major opportunity for the company.

âWe are set to help customers take advantage of breakthroughs in generative AI and large language models,â Huang said. âOur new AI supercomputer, with H100 and its Transformer Engine and Quantum-2 networking fabric, is in full production.â

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT)

These days, itâs hard to discuss AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. After all, it has made notable investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm.

During the companyâs latest earnings conference call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, âThe age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it.â

Indeed, Microsoft Azure â the software giantâs cloud computing arm â is OpenAIâs exclusive cloud provider.

Nadella said that Microsoft will deploy OpenAIâs models across its consumer and enterprise products.

Microsoft shares have climbed 33% in 2023, bringing the companyâs market cap to $2.37 trillion.

At the end of the first quarter, Cohenâs firm owned 449,115 shares of Microsoft, a stake valued at approximately $129.48 million at the time.

The Bottom Line

AI companies hold potential. But itâs crucial to bear in mind that stocks, especially high-growth names, can be volatile. And even experts like Cohen do not have a 100% win rate.
 If your goal is to earn a steady return without too many wild swings in your portfolio, you might want to look into reliable income plays â both in and outside the stock market.

2023 was a tough year for some sectors of the stock market, or at least for some sectors. The market has had a tumultuous couple of years, which started with the outbreak of the coronavirus. The pandemic cut stock markets' value by nearly one third, but the resulting recovery was equally stunning as well. The recovery proved to be a boon for the technology sector, as lockdowns grew the demand for their products. Whether it was retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), who helped people do their shopping from home, or firms like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), whose computing products surged into consumer's hands, or even companies like Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM), who surged on the stock market when the demand for remote work and video conferencing boomed, the post-pandemic stock market recovery was a great time to be in technology stocks.

Yet, as they say, all good things must come to an end - so did this good fortune for the technology companies on the stock market. In 2022 as the after effects of the expansionary fiscal policies of the pandemic government and the Russian invasion of Ukraine made their mark, technology companies dropped on the market and bled investors dry. Yet, it appears as if hedge funds are now taking these price drops as an opportunity to buy on the dip. This has been the trend in some of the hedge fund portfolios that we have analyzed so far after their filings for the first quarter of 2023 revealed portfolio compositions. For instance, billionaire David Tepper's 2023 portfolio has several new stock additions that are technology companies. These include NVIDIA and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), alongside a 390% growth in investment in Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Another popular hedge fund that increased exposure to the technology industry is Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which took up a cumulative $1.06 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Story continues

This trend, as you'll find out today, is also present when we look at another billionaire hedge fund manager's investment portfolio for Q1 2023. This manager is Dan Loeb who heads the hedge fund Third Point Management. Third Point is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, with its portfolio currently worth $6.1 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. The portfolio's size is yet to reach the level at which it stood by the end of Q1 2022, but is slowly growing to touch the previous levels.

Like some of his other hedge fund peers, Mr. Loeb is also a billionaire with Forbes Magazine placing his latest net worth estimate at $3.5 billion. His hedge fund employs a variety of trading strategies on the financial markets. These include activist investments, venture capital investments, structured and corporate credit strategies, and long and short equity investments. This enables the firm to take a look at the debt strategies of companies to leverage them to its advantage, profit from corporate management weaknesses, and capitalize on share price movements in both directions.

As for Mr. Loeb, he started tinkering with the stock market during his time in high school and continued it into college as well. He was initially quite successful, and during his time at Columbia University, he would end up making $120,000. Yet, his inexperience in the stock market made him invest all of it into a medical equipment company to lose the winnings - an occurrence that would provide him practical experience about the perils of placing all your eggs in a single basket. Before setting up Third Point Management in 1995, he would work in the financial and corporate world for a decade.

He's quite popular in the investment world as well, especially when it comes to letter writing. His latest letter was sent to the embattled firm Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. The letter criticized the firm's chairwoman and shared:

Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.

Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuilâs financial experience, this Boardâs handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.

It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.

So, wondering what's on Mr. Loeb's mind these days? Well, you came to the right place as we look at precisely that in this article, with some top picks being HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). Billionaire Dan Loeb's 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks

628,2023-05-09T20:54:40+00:00,Top 20 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands,"In this article, we will take a look at the top 20 most popular consumer electronics brands. If you want to see more brands in this selection, go to the Top 5 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands.

According to Zion Industry Research, the size of the consumer electronics industry is set to increase from $1.10 trillion in 2021 to $1.70 trillion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. China stands out as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronic goods. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the industry, considering China's position as the epi-centre of the virus. Regulations regarding social distancing and the closure of businesses led to a global reduction in the sales of electronics. For example, Sony's Electronic Products and Solutions segment experienced a decline in revenue, with sales dropping from 977.4 billion yen ($7.09 billion) in the first half of 2019 to 836.5 billion yen ($6.07 billion) in the first half of 2020 due to retail stores closing down. In addition to Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and LG also temporarily halted production in various countries to adhere to government regulations. However, one positive trend that emerged during the pandemic was the increased adoption of remote work, which led to a surge in demand for consumer electronics, particularly computing devices.

In addition to the work-from-home trend, the preference for having connected homes is supporting the expansion of the consumer electronics industry. The convenience of enhanced features, such as voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, has led to a growing adoption of appliances equipped with these tools. According to a Value of Video Report 2020 issued by Grabyo, 58% of streaming customers surveyed reported frequent video consumption on a Smart TV. Furthermore, AI technologies and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana are becoming increasingly prevalent. The market growth of consumer electronics has been further boosted by the increased demand for Asian electronic products in Western countries. According to data from The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, the production value of computers and information terminals in Japan rose by 1251.3 billion yen ($9.07 billion) in 2019 from 1041.1 billion yen ($7.55 billion) in 2017. Additionally, the rising disposable income among the population in South-East Asian nations has led to increased consumption of home appliances. This trend is expected to drive the regional market growth in the next decade.

Story continues

The key players in the consumer electronics industry, such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) are investing heavily in research and development to introduce innovative products to cater to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. Meanwhile, government authorities are also actively taking initiatives to support the growth of electronics within their countries. For instance, the Government of India introduced the National Electronics Policy in 2018. The policy intends to provide a framework to achieve a turnover of $400 billion through consumer electronics manufacturing by the middle of this decade. Achieving such a significant number would surely require greater adoption of modern technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and machine learning.

Total Score: 25

TTM Revenue: $26.97 billion

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a notable player in the consumer electronics industry and excels in providing graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Renowned for their technological prowess, NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) consumer electronics power high-performance gaming, virtual reality experiences, autonomous vehicles, and data centre solutions.

Here's what RiverPark Advisors said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our next top contributor on better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. The stock also benefitted from the positive momentum around Artificial Intelligence and the Nvidia chips that drive it. While revenue was down -21% year over year, a rebound in the companyâs gaming business helped drive revenue above Wall Streetâs expectations.

NVDA is the leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUâs) required for powerful computer processing. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved through innovation and adaptation from a predominantly gaming-focused chip vendor to one of the largest semiconductor/software vendors in the world. Over the past decade, the company has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of over 20% while expanding operating margins and, through its asset light business model, producing ever increasing amounts of free cash flow. After working through its near-term slowdown, we expect future growth to remain robust as NVDA chips and software are critical to many of the core technologies being adopted globally, including cloud computing, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.â

18. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Total Score: 26

TTM Revenue: $284.61 billion

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a variety of advanced consumer electronics through Google and other subsidiaries. From smartphones like the Pixel series to smart home devices such as Google Nest and Chromecast, Alphabet Inc.

âWe did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon,Â Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.â

17. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)

Total Score: 27

TTM Revenue: $60.59 billion

âNew positions initiated in Q4 included shortsÂ International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBMâs 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the companyâs legacy businesses.â

16. Fujitsu Limited (6702.T)

Total Score: 28

âAlso on the detractor side,Â Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.â

Microsoftâs net cash balance sheet also seemed to gain appreciation from investors who became more cautious about the economic cycle.â

7. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG)

Total Score: 39

TTM Revenue: $18.08 billion

Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), commonly known as Philips, is a multinational conglomerate that operates in various industries, including consumer electronics. Philips offers a wide variety of consumer electronics, including televisions, audio systems, lighting solutions, personal care tools, and household appliances.

Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) was mentioned in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Artisan Partners. Hereâs what the firm said:

âShares ofÂ Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), a health care technology company, were hurt by fears regarding the recall of its first-generation CPAP machine and the potential for legal recourse and market share losses arising in its sleep division. Adding to the companyâs woes are supply chain disruptions and a worsening macro environment that will weigh on deliveries and customer installations. The stock is down more than 70%, losing more than â¬30 billion in market value from its April 2021 highs. The stock reaction seems excessive given the likely range of outcomes we see, so weâve been adding to our position. The sleep division is a small part of the overall businessâwhich we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We appreciate that until there is greater clarity on the full impact of the recall and how long it may take to resolve, the stock will remain under pressure, but we believe todayâs asking price offers the potential for highly attractive multi-year returns.â

6. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ)

HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), or the Hewlett-Packard Company, is a Palo Alto, California-based consumer electronics giant known for its laptops, desktop computers, printers, scanners, and accessories.

630,2023-05-09T19:55:33+00:00,Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,"Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is up by a considerable 30% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's  ROE today.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investorsâ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

View our latest analysis for Alphabet

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) Ã· Shareholders' Equity

So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:

22% = US$59b Ã· US$261b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).

The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that donât share these attributes.

A Side By Side comparison of Alphabet's Earnings Growth And 22% ROE

To begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.1% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 26% net income growth seen by Alphabet over the past five years isn't overly surprising.

As a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.3%.

Story continues past-earnings-growth

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. Itâs important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.

Is Alphabet Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?

Alphabet doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.

Summary

Overall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

Britainâs competition watchdog has been warned it risks a âbetrayal of antitrust principlesâ by the chief executive of one of the worldâs biggest gaming companies.

Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic Games, said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) would be guilty of âa complete failure of regulationâ if it allows Google to continue charging app makers high fees on its download stores. The regulator faces mounting scrutiny of its approach to technology after blocking the merger of gaming giants Microsoft and Activision.

The two companies have hit out at the regulatorâs decision, fuelling concerns that Britain is becoming an unattractive place for technology businesses.

Mr Sweeney's warning comes as the CMA prepares to rule on an investigation into Google's app store

Google and Apple charge developers fees of up to 30pc on purchases of apps and payments within apps, in what has been likened to a tax on the internet.

Last month, the CMA said Google had offered to let developers use alternative payment systems on its Android Play Store but would continue to collect fees of up to 27pc, down from todayâs 30pc. The regulator is consulting on the proposals, paving the way for possible acceptance.

Mr Sweeney told The Telegraph: âIf the UK endorses the Google proposal, it is a betrayal of the antitrust principles and regulatory principles that are supposed to be in play here.

âIf a major world powerâs regulatory authority endorses a 27pc monopoly rent applicationâ¦ that is a complete failure of regulation.

âIt would be a shameful outcome for the whole world. Because that is not restoring competition, that is giving legitimacy to what under antitrust law is supposed to be an illegal practice.â

Epic Games is the developer of Fortnite, one of the worldâs most popular games. The company, which Mr Sweeney founded in 1991, was valued at $30bn last year.

Mr Sweeney has led a long-running campaign against Apple and Googleâs hugely profitable app stores.

Story continues

Apple and Google make billions from fees charged by their smartphone download stores. Apple does not allow alternatives to its App Store, while Google has been accused of suppressing alternative stores, despite technically allowing them.

Epic Games, which also owns titles such as Fall Guys and Among Us, has filed legal challenges seeking to force Apple and Google to cut its fees and open up their operating systems to alternative stores.

Fortnite was kicked off both tech giantsâ stores in 2020 after it sought to circumvent their payment methods. Epic immediately sued both companies separately in the US courts under a campaign it called âProject Libertyâ. The company has been largely unsuccessful against Apple. Its case against Google is scheduled to go to court in November.

However, the cause has been picked up by regulators. A White House report recently called the companiesâ practices âharmful to developers and consumersâ and upcoming EU regulations are expected to force the companies to allow alternative app stores to operate on their devices.

In Britain, Apple has won a legal block against the CMAâs investigation into the App Store, although the regulator said last week it would appeal. Comments on Googleâs proposal were due by the end of last week, with a final outcome set to follow. FILE - Twitter, now X.

Mr Sweeney, 52, is as much a lobbyist as a coder these days. He has pressed regulators around the world to rein in tech giants, and insists that his arguments against Apple and Googleâs fees remain strong.

He said: âThe world has to change in order for any tech business to be interesting and valuable in the future, other than Apple and Google. If they're allowed to continue to maintain and expand their monopoly and their tiesâ¦ then no business other than Apple and Google have a future as top level companies in the tech industry, anywhere in the world.

âThere are now so many efforts around the world that it gives one hope that at some point, one of the regulators will actually break through.â

Mr Sweeney has secured a powerful recent ally in Elon Musk, who has accused Apple of a âsecret 30pc taxâ since buying Twitter and said the iPhone maker and Google âcontrol access to most of the internetâ. Tim Cook invited Mr Musk to Appleâs California headquarters in November, and since then the Tesla billionaire has been less outspoken.

âMost [app makers] are afraid to talk about it. You have a very small number who are not,â said Mr Sweeney. âElon Musk is going to share his opinion. He gets invited to Cupertino to have one-on-one discussions with Tim Cook about their problems, I wish more developers got that.â

Mr Sweeneyâs disappointment with the CMA is especially strong because the regulator has shown itself to be more forceful than others on Big Tech. Its block of Microsoftâs Activision takeover came even as EU regulators approved the deal, and led Microsoftâs Brad Smith to declare that Europe was a better place to start a business than Britain.

Mr Sweeney says that the deal was âreally complicatedâ but rejects the idea that a strong regulator is bad for investment, or as Activision put it, that it shows Britain is âclosed for businessâ.

âI think the headline ought to be âBritain is closed to monopoly entrenchmentâ. That would be a very good thing, and would be great for business. You have very powerful companies who are disappointed that regulators are regulating,â he says.
He urged the CMA not to be cowed by the tech giants and stand firm against Google.

âI think there's nothing more important that Britain can do to create a vibrant future for competition and digital markets than to enforce the antitrust laws and to set an example for the whole world.â

Mr Sweeney believes he must pursue his battle now because, if left unchecked, Apple and Google would throttle the development of the âmetaverseâ, the 3D online worlds that some techies see as the future of the internet.

Fortnite was one of the pioneers of the idea of a virtual world inhabited by many hundreds, if not thousands, of people at once.

Interest in the concept has cooled in recent months, but Mr Sweeney insists it still has a bright future. FILE - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Paley Center in New York, Oct. 25, 2019.

âPeople are realising that huge amounts of companies have raised huge amounts of money based on scams. And that market is now going to be cleaned up through the creative destruction process.

âIf you look at Fortnite and [other open world online games] Minecraft and Roblox, Pub-G mobile and a few other of these apps, you can find 600 million people who are doing this every month and having a great time with it. I remain an optimist.â

By contrast, the online world created by Mark Zuckerbergâs Meta, which is seen as the most vocal proponent of the metaverse, âisnât a fun place to beâ, Mr Sweeney said. However, he believes that a lot of the companyâs investments in virtual reality will pay off.

Mr Sweeneyâs concerns about Apple controlling the metaverse will be enhanced by reports that the company is expected to enter the space with a headset next month.

âI totally support Apple and Google building innovative new hardware,â Mr Sweeney said. âThey should sell their hardware for a great price and earn a great profit from their hardware but they must be removed from the business of determining how other businesses can compete with them.â

Even if he insists that the two tech giants are strangling his company, Epic Games has been more successful than Mr Sweeney would have imagined when he set the company in his parentsâ basement 32 years ago.

Fortniteâs dramatic success â the game has around 400m players â is augmented by the companyâs PC download store and its Unreal Engine, simulation software that is used by others to create games but also plan film sets and airports.
Bloomberg puts his wealth at $9.7bn, largely down to his 28pc stake in Epic, with voting shares granting him majority control over the company.

âMy life hasnât changed much â I have a faster car,â Mr Sweeney said. Â âThe majority of my net worth is just in the company, not closets full of gold or something.â

A range of elaborate scams have driven the UKâs fraud epidemic to new heights, with consumers losing thousands of pounds to fraudsters.

Among the most convincing scam of the year so far is pig butchering, according to consumer body Which?.

Pig butchering

These scams get their name because the fraudster ""fattens up"" the victim by forming a romantic connection before executing the investment part of the scam.

The scammer and victim typically meet on a dating site and the victim is ""love-bombed"" over a period of weeks by someone who appears to take a great interest in their life.

The scammer will often encourage their victim to move from the dating platform to a private messaging service, thus removing them from any protections the dating site might offer.

When the victim is sufficiently groomed, the scammer claims they have been having success investing â typically in property or cryptocurrency â and they offer to invest some of the victimâs money.

If the victim agrees, they are sometimes shown a crypto trading platform controlled by the scammers, and encouraged to sign up and begin depositing funds.

One UK victim, a former Somerset police officer, lost Â£107,000 to such a scam, believing she was investing in retirement apartments in Cyprus.

To avoid the scam, look out for signs of ""love-bombing"" â where someone seeks to quickly obtain affection and attention by ""bombing"" with gifts, compliments, and affection â attempts to move onto a private messaging platform, reluctance to meet in person and requests for money or a concerted effort to get the person to ""invest"".

For those in an online relationship, it is worth checking in with a friend or a member of your family on how it is going, sometimes other people can help to spot warning signs and inconsistencies when we are too caught up in the moment.

Fake missing person appeals

There has been a spate of viral fake posts in community social media pages worldwide about missing children or elderly people.

People are asked to share these Facebook posts more widely. Which?âs experts know they are fake because you can find near-identical posts in community pages all over the world, simply with the location changed. Search ""Robert Spall dementia"" on Facebook and you will find the same post in pages for California, USA and Bogota, Colombia.

Read more: Scam adverts still rife on Facebook and Instagram

Comments are invariably turned off on the posts to avoid people pointing out the inconsistencies. After the post has gained a large number of likes, the contents are edited into something completely different, such as a straightforward investment scam. The large number of likes and shares that stay on the post will then lend credibility to the fraud. This scam relies on responsible citizens liking and sharing posts in an attempt to help â which they do, in large numbers.

While missing person posts can of course be genuine, it can be difficult to tell. To avoid perpetuating a scam or unwittingly participating in stalking or harassment, people are best off only sharing official posts, such as those posted by police forces or the Missing People charity (missingpeople.org.uk).

Some regional police forces have warned that you should never like or share a post that has the comments turned off.

PayPal scam

This scam starts with people getting a money request from a genuine PayPal (PYPL) email address â service@paypal.com. This might seem above board, but scammers are exploiting PayPalâs service to send out fake payment requests, often for high-value items, or posing as HMRC to demand ""overdue"" tax payments.

In some versions of the scam, the fake invoice states the victimâs PayPal account has been compromised and urges them to call a phoney fraud hotline.

Which? has found it is easy to replicate scam emails from a genuine PayPal address. Which?âs request claimed to be from HMRC and threatened the recipient with arrest if they did not pay. Acting as the recipient, Which? researchers were then able to pay the invoice without creating a PayPal account and without encountering any on-screen warnings about fraud.

Consumers should never pay PayPal invoices they do not recognise, or call phone numbers in those invoices. Think about how to independently verify what is being asked. If the message claims to be from HMRC, contact the tax office via gov.uk. If the message claims PayPal has been hacked, contact its customer services at paypal.com/uk/smarthelp/contact-us.

Fake app alert

With 96% of UK mobile users downloading apps from the Apple App Store (AAPL) or Google Play (GOOG), you would probably assume that these stores are safe places to be, and that the apps on these platforms can be trusted. Unfortunately, that is not always the case.

The stores do screen apps before they upload them, but that does not always stop malicious ones slipping through the net. These can install malware on phones, steal data and perpetuate scams.

Last year, online security firm Praedo discovered a so-called security app on Google Play. Calling itself 2FA Authenticator, it actually stole usersâ banking information â and had been installed more than 10,000 times before it was discovered.

In 2022, Facebookâs parent company, Meta (META), found 400 Android and iOS apps stealing usersâ Facebook login details. App stores do take steps to crack down on the problem, but this is an ever-present threat.

When installing an app, click on the developerâs name and check what other apps it is made to see if these seem legitimate. Check reviews, but remember positive ones can be faked. Read the negative ones, too. The app will likely ask users for permissions: to use the camera, for example. These need to be relevant and proportionate to the functions of the app â an app that only needs a rough location should not ask for a precise one.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Gebru has all the hallmarks of a Big Tech star: a masters and PhD from Stanford, engineering and research roles at Apple and Microsoft before joining Google as an A.I. expert.

But in 2020 her time co-leading the ethical A.I. team at the Alphabet-owned company came to an end, a decision triggered by a paper she wrote warning of the bias being embedded into artificial intelligence.

Bias is a topic that experts in the field have raised for many years.

In 2015 Google apologized and said it was ""appalled"" by its photos appâpowered by A.I.âlabeling a photograph of a black couple as ""gorillas.""

Warnings about A.I. bias are now becoming higher profileâearlier this year the World Health Organization said that although it welcomed improved access to health information, the datasets used to train such models may have biases already built in.

Such cautions are the reason the public needs to remember it has ""agency"" over what happens with artificial intelligence, argued Gebru.

In an interview with The Guardian, the 40-year-old said: ""It feels like a gold rush. In fact, itÂ isÂ a gold rush.

""And a lot of the people who are making money are not the people actually in the midst of it. But itâs humans who decide whether all this should be done or not. We should remember that we have the agency to do that.â

Gebru also pushed for clarification on what regulation would entail, after thousands of tech bossesâincluding Tesla's Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and OpenAI's Sam Altmanâsaid some guardrails need to be put on the industry.

Story continues

But leaving it to tech bosses to regulate themselves wouldn't work, Gebru continued: ""Unless there is external pressure to do something different, companies are not just going to self-regulate. We need regulation and we need something better than just a profit motive.â

It's humansânot robots

The founder and director of The Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR)âan independent A.I. research unitâalso had a powerful reminder about the hypothetical threat the technology is posing to humanity.

Fears range from a Terminator-like apocalypseâif you ask Muskâto the technology being used as a weapon of war, with others suggesting that the technology already thinks of mankind as ""scum"".

Gebru isn't sold.

""A.I. is not magic,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people involvedâhumans.â

She said the theories that services like large language models could one day think for themselves ""ascribes agency to a tool rather than the humans building the tool.""

""That means you can aggregate responsibility: âItâs not me thatâs the problem. Itâs the tool. Itâs super-powerful. We donât know what itâs going to do.â Well, noâitâs you thatâs the problem,"" Gebru continued.

""Youâre building something with certain characteristics for your profit. Thatâs extremely distracting and takes the attention away from real harms and things we need to do. Right now.""

However Gebru remained optimistic: ""Maybe, if enough people do small things and get organized, things will change. Thatâs my hope.â

""We are challenging Montanaâs unconstitutional TikTok ban to protect our business and the hundreds of thousands of TikTok users in Montana,"" a TikTok spokesperson said. ""We believe our legal challenge will prevail based on an exceedingly strong set of precedents and facts.""

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the state ban into law on May 17. If the ban withstands TikTok's challenge, it will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2024. TikTok's isn't the only suit challenging the ban. A group of five TikTok users is already suing the state to block the law, according to Reuters.

The ban would hold companies like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) liable if they make TikTok available for download in the state. Each violation would cost the companies $10,000 per user and an additional $10,000 for each day the app remains available.

In an email announcing the lawsuit, TikTok lays out four different reasons for why it believes the ban should be blocked: First Amendment concerns, questions over federal preemption of state laws, the Constitution's Commerce Clause, and that the bill specifically targets TikTok and not social media companies in general.

TikTok claims the lawsuit violates the First Amendment by preventing the company and its users from accessing the app and shutting down a forum of free speech. As for federal preemption, the company says the ban is based on Montana's concerns about national security. Because of that, it states Montana can't pass the ban since national security falls under the federal government's purview.

TikTok further claims the ban also violates the Constitution's Commerce Clause because it ""risks disrupting the flow of travel and commerce between states.""

First Amendment experts have already come forward saying the ban likely violates both TikTok's and user's free speech rights.

Story continues

""The ban is a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion on the First Amendment rights of Montanans,"" Ramya Krishnan, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute and a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School told Yahoo Finance. ""To justify the ban, Montana would have to show that it's necessary to prevent actual harms. And it hasn't done this.""

In a statement after signing the bill, Gianforte said the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to ""spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect personal, private, and sensitive information.""

But David Greene, civil liberties director and senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Yahoo Finance that the law is simply too broad.

""This law, as a restriction on the way Montanans speak and receive speech, will need to be justified by the state as an appropriately narrow and effective way of protecting Montanansâ personal data. That will be very difficult to do.""

There was a great deal of fascination with the milestones at the time. Subsequently, both overcame the $2 trillion mark,Â  and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also joined the $1 trillion club. I guess itâs natural that the first companies to cross that huge $1 trillion threshold would get by far the most attention. Still, I find it interesting to contemplate the question of which names will be the next stocks to become future $2 trillion companies.

Certainly, the advent of a few new technologies will make it much easier for more firms to become future $2 trillion companies in the future. Of course, thereâs the transition to the cloud, which was the key factor that enabled MSFTâs market capitalization to eclipse $1 trillion, then $2 trillion. Now AI has become the next, big technology that will propel multiple firms to become the future $2 trillion companies. Some of those companies could include:

ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) will join the $2 trillion companiesâ list thanks to its time-and-money-saving technology which incorporates âworkflow automationâ and âartificial intelligence.âÂ As I explained in a past column, NOW allows firms âto automate many routine IT tasks.â In my opinion, NOW will continue to deliver great financial results and grow rapidly because there are few things that firms like better than large, nearly immediate cost savings.

Further, as AI advances, NOWâs solutions are also likely to become even more helpful and financially rewarding to its customers.Â Indeed, itâs encouraging that NOW isnât resting on its laurels and is increasing its exposure to AI, as it recently boughtG2K. The latter firmâs technology uses AI to enhance companiesâ ability to analyze data.

Also positive is NOWâs decision to, for the first time buy back NOW stock. Specifically, the company disclosed on May 17 that it plans to purchase $1.5 billion of NOW stock. The move will hasten the companyâs path to the $2 trillion level and shows that it has more confidence than ever in its ability to become one of the worldâs most valuable companies.

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is not that far away from becoming one of the first companies to reach the $2 trillion market. Right now, its market capitalization stands at $1.185 trillion.

Of course, Amazonâs cloud business is continuing to grow rapidly, and that will help it reach the $2 trillion club. Also growing rapidly is Amazonâs ad business. Moreover, I remain convinced that, at some point this year, consumers will reduce their spending on experiences and increase the percentage of the funds that they spend on products. That will be positive for Amazonâs massive e-commerce business and for AMZN stock. Also noteworthy is that all of the companyâs businesses that Iâve mentioned so far can be meaningfully boosted by AI.

Another key to AMZN becoming one of the $2 trillion companies of the future is its ability to disrupt Americaâs highly inefficient pharmaceutical sector. As Iâve mentioned in the past, by cutting out multiple âmiddlemen,â Amazon will be able to, through its new Amazon Clinic service, provide drugs much more cheaply to Americans versus what theyâre currently paying. I believe that will become a huge business for AMZN within a year or two.

Finally, autonomous driving and other technological innovations will allow Amazonâs e-commerce business to accelerate its market-share gains.

Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) 7 Stocks to Buy Benefiting From Millennial Money

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also nearing the $2 trillion mark. In fact, its current market cap stands at $1.56 trillion.Â I think itâs worth noting that I expect GOOG to reach $2 trillion in the next year or two.Â Of course, AI will boost the effectiveness of the companyâs search engine business. Consequently, the search engineâs revenue growth will accelerate as it takes tremendous market share from non-digital ad platforms.

Alphabet can also use AI to enhance the âstickinessâ of YouTube, and the service will be able to make its ads much more interactive. Additionally, Alphabet should be able to offer AI services via Google Cloud.Â Finally, I expect Waymo, Alphabetâs autonomous-driving unit, to, within the next few years, start generating significant amounts of revenue for Alphabet.

Chinese automaker BYD (OTC:BYDDF) has become the worldâs leading seller of electric vehicles if one counts plug-in hybrids as EVs. Moreover, the automaker generates a significant amount of revenue from selling electric buses and batteries for EVs, large-scale electricity storage, and consumer-electronic products. I expect the demand for all of these ancillary products to grow significantly over the longer term.

Also in the longer term, I predict that BYDâs revenue from subscriptions that it sells to the owners of its EVs will soar. Thatâs because, as time goes on, the ability of automakers to offer subscriptions for services like monitoring data and enhancing vehiclesâ security is likely to increase meaningfully.

Further, BYD will probably greatly increase its deliveries in other countries in the coming years. Thatâs because it appears to, more than any other EV maker, have developed the ability to manufacture affordable yet popular and profitable EVs.Â For example, its Seagull EV costs $11,300 in Europe and should be very appealing to many European consumers.

Powered by Nvidiaâs (NASDAQ:NVDA) sales of chips for use in developing AI, Nvidia stock is closing in on the $1 trillion market, as its market capitalization as of the market close on May 22 was $771 billion.Â Within the next few years, I believe that Nvidiaâs opportunity in AI will probably enable it to be one of the next stocks to reach the $2 trillion level.

Adding to my conviction about the strong, longer-term outlook of NVDA stock, Bank of America is estimating that the total available market for AI accelerators may reach $50 billion to $60 billion in 2027. And the bank believes that NVDA is well-positioned to succeed in that market since Nvidia already has all of the elements that it needs in the sector, while âmany competitorsâ will need a decade or more to catch up with it.

Meanwhile, two investment banks â Oppenheimer and Susquehanna â also recently expressed optimism about Nvidiaâs opportunity in the AI space. The banks believe that the proliferation of AI is enabling Nvidia to sell many more of its graphics processing units, which are used to create AI.

Finally, last month CNBCreported that âNvidiaâs most-advanced graphics cards are selling for more than $40,000 on eBay,â amid strong demand from AI developers.

Merck (MRK)

Merckâs (NYSE:MRK) Keytruda is one of, if not the most, successful cancer drugs of all time. The treatment generated $20.9 billion in sales for Merck last year. And the pharmaceutical giant is constantly taking steps that enable the drug to be used to combat new types of cancers. For example, just earlier this month, it presented data showing that the drug, in combination with chemotherapy,Â  raised overall survival rates in first-line lung cancer, The data will likely lead to a new approval for Keytruda in Europe.

Keytrudaâs patent will expire in 2028, but Merck appears to be taking steps, including working on â two subcutaneous versions of Keytruda.â that will likely wind up extending the drugâs patent protection,

And crucially, Merck has shown the willingness and ability to make positive, game-changing acquisitions. One recent deal in that category was its agreement, made last month, to take over Prometheus Bio (NASDAQ:RXDX). The latter firm has developed â a treatment for inflammatory bowel diseaseâ that looks poised to become very successful. In a trial late last year, 26.5% of ulcerative colitis patients who took Prometheusâ drug entered remission, versus just 1.5% of those who received placebos.

Many Wall Street analysts are upbeat on the drug, and it does seem poised to make a great deal of money for Merck.Â With Keytruda likely to generate huge revenue and profits for Merck well into the future and the company making superb acquisitions, MRK stock looks poised to reach the $2 trillion mark in 2028 or shortly thereafter.

Eli Lilly (LLY)

Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has two blockbuster drugs on the way that will very likely enable LLY to become one of the next $2 trillion companies.Â LLYâs Alzheimerâs treatment, donanemab, âwas effective in reducing cognitive and functional decline in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimerâs disease,â the company reported last month.

Meanwhile, the companyâs weight-loss drug, Mounjaro, has demonstrated the ability to enable Type 2 diabetes patients to exercise âchronic weight management.â And the FDA may approve the drug as a treatment for all obese and overweight patients âas soon asâ this year.Â Taken together, I believe that these drugs will enable LLY stock to eclipse the $2 trillion mark in 2028 or not very long thereafter.

650,2023-05-08T17:39:13+00:00,15 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds,"In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to hedge funds. For more top AI stocks, head on over to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.

The hottest trend in technology right now is artificial intelligence. This is simply due to the fact that for the general consumer, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with sci-fi grade technology with the potential to create entities with human like intelligence and response. However, until most of 2022, such technologies were not available to captivate the public attention. Most chatbots were rather rudimentary and lacked the ability to provide detailed responses.

However, all this changed with the release of ChatGPT, a conversational assistant trained on vast amounts of data and capable of generating human like responses to queries. ChatGPT set the internet on fire, and within days and weeks after its initial and public release, all tech and non tech publications were simply gushing about the assistant. As is the case with hype, it often goes far beyond what logic might suggest, and soon we were being warned that professionals such as lawyers might have to switch careers as a virtual assistant can provide better services.

All this hype has made everyone forget what artificial intelligence really is. Simply put, AI is the use of complex mathematical techniques to use a set of inputs, plug them in an equation, and then determine the most likely set of outcomes. So, if you ask ChatGPT about companies with reusable rockets, it will sift through its data to determine which are the most likely matches and likely give you an answer that includes SpaceX.

This utility of using large scale data analysis to generate a likely set of outputs provides artificial intelligence with far more utility than a simple chatbot. One of the best use cases of artificial intelligence that does not involve talking is autonomous driving. This involves feeding a computer in a car data through a variety of sensors such as LiDAR sensors, and programming it in such a way that it is able to make decisions that mimic human behavior like knowing when to stop and when to turn. Building on this, the consulting firm McKinsey takes a look at other sectors that can use AI. Its report for the 2022 use cases for AI shows that a variety of sectors such as robotic process automation, knowledge graphs, facial recognition, and recommender systems are using artificial intelligence as well. Functionally speaking, McKinsey reports that the largest users of artificial intelligence are service operators, customer service analytics, and customer generation and lead generation platforms.

One firm that leads in the customer services arena is Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). It provides customer engagement and analytics platforms. During its earnings call for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, its executives shared the inside scoop on Salesforce's Einstein GPT - the world's first generative language artificial intelligence platform for customer relationship management and details for other plans to integrate AI into the overall business.

During the event, they shared:

EinsteinGPT will be integrated into all of our clouds as well as Tableau, MuleSoft and Slack. And then thereâs another way weâre opening the door to use AI for our future and for all of our customersâ, as we have begun working with the rapidly expanding AI ecosystem in our industry, Iâve been really impressed with how companies like Anthropic, a leading provider of generative AI, are using Slack as their user interface for generative AI assistance. The relevance of Slack as an incredible enterprise productivity platform, user interface and critical data set for these new AI systems, while itâs inspiring all kinds of new use cases, I couldnât be more excited about the future. To wrap it up, our transformation is happening now. Weâre making Salesforce one of the most profitable software companies in the world with one of the highest cash flows and one of the very largest as well.

Given these explosive use cases, it's important to look at a wide list of firms currently developing and deploying the AI technology. Some topics AI picks from hedge funds include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds

654,2023-05-08T15:05:42+00:00,"Inflation reading, consumer sentiment, Pinduoduo: 3 things to watch","Investing.com -- Stocks wobbled on Thursday as Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) outlook lifted tech stocks despite worries that there still was no resolution to the ongoing debt ceiling standoff.

Nvidia is projecting a record quarter because of surging demand for chips that help power artificial intelligence technology, especially around generative chatbots that have caught the public's attention in the last few months. Tech giants from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google are driving demand for the chips, as are cloud services providers.

The positive outlook is lifting shares of other chip makers, which are also seen benefiting from the trend at varying degrees.

The enthusiasm is drowning out fears about a possible government default if the debt ceiling issue isn't resolved in the next week. Biden administration officials have warned that Congress has until June 1 or thereabouts to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before it runs out of options. But negotiators are still trying to hammer out details on spending levels with Congress set to break for the long holiday weekend.

Friday brings additional information on inflation that the Federal Reserve will be closely watching as it heads into its June policy meeting. Expectations are now rising that the Fed will raise rates again in June, with futures traders being almost evenly split between a rate hike and a pause. Just days ago, most futures traders expected that the Fed would pause in June.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Inflation data

The personal consumption expenditure index, a closely watched barometer of inflation, is expected out at 8:30 ET (12:30 GMT). Analysts expect the April number rose 3.9% from the same month last year and 0.4% from March. Personal income is seen rising 0.4% for the month and spending 0.4% for the month.

2. Consumer sentiment

The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for May is expected out at 10:00 ET. Analysts expect a reading of 57.9, more pessimistic than the previous reading.

3. Pinduoduo earnings

The Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) is expected to report earnings per share of $4.47 on revenue of $32.1 billion.

And now the company has filed a lawsuit against the state.

âWe believe that the Montana bill that was recently passed is simply unconstitutional,â TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said at the Qatar Economic Forum. âWe very recently filed a lawsuit to challenge this in the courts, and we are confident that we will prevail.â

U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns that the Chinese government may potentially access U.S. data through the app. But Chew denies that possibility.

âThe Chinese government never asked us for U.S. usersâ data, and we will not provide even if asked,â he said.

âWe have built over the last two years something we call internally 'Project Texas',â Chew added. âWhat it really is is to ensure that American data is stored on American soil by an American company and overseen by American personnel.â

Concerns regarding TikTokâs potential impact on national security extend beyond the state level. Previously, TikTok said that the Biden administration wanted the app to be divested from its Chinese parent company or face a potential ban.

The possibility of further bans on TikTok poses a significant threat to its business. But it also presents opportunities for the appâs U.S. competitors. Here are three rival companies that could capitalize on the situation.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)

As the parent company of Google, Alphabet was created in 2015 to give Googleâs wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.

Alphabet also presents itself as a formidable competitor to TikTok. The company has introduced YouTube Shorts on its video-sharing platform, allowing users to create and share short-form videos directly competing with TikTokâs format.

According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, this new format has been gaining popularity.

âLast year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%,â he said during the companyâs latest earnings conference call. âThose posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts posts.â

Commanding a market cap of over $1.5 trillion, Alphabet is already a tech behemoth. But the stock can still be volatile. Shares plunged 39% in 2022 but have surged 38% so far in 2023.

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META)

Facebook parent Meta Platforms is another mega-cap stock that took investors on a wild ride â shares of the social media behemoth tumbled 64% in 2022 but have already doubled in 2023.

While Metaâs main platform is renowned for its social networking features, the company has made notable efforts to challenge TikTokâs dominance in short-form video content. Meta introduced Reels on Instagram and Facebook, enabling users to create and share short videos with captivating effects and music.

During Metaâs first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that users are resharing Reels over 2 billion times every day.

âReels are also increasing overall app engagement, and we believe that we're gaining share in short-form video too,â he added.

Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP)

With a market cap of around $15.6 billion, Snap is considerably smaller than Meta and Alphabet. But its core product Snapchat is a social media platform that focuses on short-form video content, positioning it as a direct competitor to TikTok.

Snap initially gained popularity for its disappearing photo and video messages but has evolved into a feature-rich multimedia platform with augmented reality filters, chat functions and discoverable content.

In the first quarter, the company had 383 million daily active users, marking a 15% increase year over year. According to the latest investor presentation, Snapchat now reaches 90% of the 13- to 24-year-old population in over 20 countries.

But the stock hasnât been a hot commodity. Shares of Snap are down about 30% over the last 12 months.

Stocks are volatile, and even mega-cap names like Meta and Alphabet are not immune to the marketâs wild swings. If your goal is to earn a steady stream of passive income, you might want to look into reliable dividend plays â both in and outside the stock market.

657,2023-05-08T11:45:00+00:00,Billionaire Stanley Druckenmillerâs 2023 Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,"In this article, we will take a look at billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's 2023 portfolio and his top 10 stock picks. To see more such companies, go directly to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.

Pessimism, doom and gloom was starting to be visible in Stanley Druckenmillerâs tone last year when the billionaire repeatedly warned about the upcoming collapse and recession. At a conference in New York in September last year, the 69-year old billionaire went so far as to say heâd be âstunnedâ if we didnât have a recession in 2023. The reason behind Druckenmillerâs pessimism is simple. He believes quantitative easing that went on for almost a decade has created the troubles we are facing today.

Last year the billionaire said the Fed policymakers âhave put themselves and the country, and most importantly the people of the country, in a terrible position.â

Druckenmiller was, however, concerned that the Federal Reserve would stop raising interest rates before reaching its target.

âI hope they finish the job. You have to slay the dragon,â Druckenmiller said.

Druckenmillerâs fear stems from his idea that inflation should be controlled and never be left unchecked. He said during his Bloomberg interview that inflation is a âkillerâ and to maximize employment prices should be stabilized. However, he doesnât think controlling inflation is as simple as raising interest rates. This worked in the 1980s, according to the billionaire, because âthe economy wasnât nearly as leveraged and we had not been through an asset bubble.â

Druckenmiller Shorting Stocks

Talking to Bloomberg, Druckenmiller in September revealed that he was shorting stocks and his portfolio had been 0% to 20% short since January 5. Interestingly, Druckenmiller at the time said that crypto might gain more popularity if distrust in central banks increases.

In 2023 we saw how regional banks started to waver after the SVB collapse and crypto also posted a strong rally.

But donât let Druckenmillerâs pessimism make you believe that itâs time to sell. On the contrary, Druckenmiller has been buying a lot of stocks and adding to his portfolio. His first quarter of 2023 portfolio shows that he bought several technology stocks, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Marvell Technology Inc.

Druckenmiller's Thoughts on AI

Part of the reason why the billionaire piled into technology this year is his bullishness on AI. At the 2023 Sohn Conference, Druckenmiller said that AI could be â every bit as impactful as the internet.â In addition to buying MSFT, GOOGL and AMZN during the first quarter, his hedge fund also bought a huge stake in Iqvia Holdings Inc., a healthcare technology company which boasts AI capabilities.Â  The companyâs management briefly touched upon its Embedded Intelligence solutions in Q4 earnings call:

âAs you know, IQVIAâs Human Data Science Cloud offers clients a combination of extensive data networks, data integration, and embedded intelligence, all of which help our clients deal with the challenge of increased data complexity and volume. A top-10 pharma awarded IQVIA our largest ever commercial managed services deal where we will take responsibility for managing the end-to-end commercial analytics for all their commercial brands globally. Personalization of care is becoming a focus of our customersâ commercial strategy. This quarter, IQVIA was awarded a major patient support program by a top-10 pharma for their cardiology product displacing the incumbent vendor.â

But it wasnât just AI that Druckenmiller talked about in at the Sohn Conference. Pessimism and warnings again prevailed the billionaireâs tone as he said the major downturn and recession he has been warning about could be visible as soon as the current quarter.

While the billionaire said that the recession would not be as bad as seen in 2008, he said that âitâs just naive not to be open-minded to something really, really bad happening.""

The falling retail sales and banking crisis have made it clear to Druckenmiller that we are headed for a hard landing. Unlike others, Druckenmiller doesnât let vague terms go undefined. He believes hard landing is when the unemployment rate exceeds 5%, corporate profits fall at least 20% and bankruptcies rise.

""Unbelievable Opportunities""

Yet, Druckenmiller said there would be a âunbelievable opportunitiesâ in the next couple of years and recommended investors to preserve their capital before these opportunities present themselves. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller 2023 Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks

Arm technology enables many AI applications and will be fundamental to building the next wave of AI innovations, BloombergÂ cites CEO Rene Haas at the Computex trade show in Taiwan on Monday. Arm launched two new products to boost smartphone performance, including the Arm Cortex-X4, its fourth-generation Cortex-X core, and the Arm Immortalis-G720, based on its fifth-generation GPU architecture. The British chip designer touted the Cortex-X4 as the fastest CPU it is made so far, with a focus on enabling artificial intelligence and machine learning-based apps. Arm also launched a new platform called for mobile computing called Arm Total Compute Solutions 2023 (TCS23). It also maintained its partnership withÂ Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd (NYSE: TSM). Arm is chasing a lofty valuation taking a cue fromÂ NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), which is on the verge of becoming the first trillion-dollar chipmaker thanks to the AI wave. Haas said that on-device and small-scale AI processors would all run Arm technology, citing examples fromÂ Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alexa voice assistant and Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Pixel phones to smart traffic light management and robotic beehive maintenance. He quoted Nvidia's Grace Hopper's next-generation architecture for accelerating AI as another example of Arm technology in the AI supply chain. Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal expected Softbank to play the AI card to tap investor interest for Arm, despite most of its current business being based on designing and licensing semiconductor IP, particularly for mobile devices. Price Action: SFTBF shares closed higher by 1.94% at $37.39 on Friday.

The stock rose as much as 7.7% early in the session, putting Nvidia well into $1 trillion territory, before retreating from the milestone during the afternoon. Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are the only other US businesses to have trillion-dollar valuations, and fewer than 10 companies globally have achieved the distinction.

Nvidia was up 3% to $401.11 as of the close in New York, putting its market capitalization at $990.7 billion.

No other company embodies Wall Streetâs current obsession with AI more than Nvidia. It has become the worldâs biggest maker of the specialized chips needed to power a new generation of AI products, surpassing Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. in capability just as the viral success of ChatGPT has virtually every company around the world baking AI into its operations.

In a speech at the National Taiwan University over the weekend, Jensen Huang shared the philosophy that has brought his company to this moment: âRun, donât walk,â he said. âEither you are running for food, or you are running from becoming food.â

@vladsavov explains Huang's rise and Nvidia's shift from gaming to AI https://t.co/BqBpe27PC8 pic.twitter.com/3MQ1lFSRgT

â Bloomberg Quicktake (@Quicktake) May 30, 2023

Huangâs urgency â and his willingness to take risks that other rule-by-committee businesses dare not â is what compelled Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker he founded 30 years ago, to make big bets on artificial intelligence years before anyone else was taking it seriously. Today, itâs proving to be the companyâs golden goose.

Nvidiaâs shares have soared since last week when it gave an AI-fueled sales forecast that shattered Wall Streetâs estimates. The stock continued to gain Tuesday after announcing several new artificial intelligence-related products over the weekend that touch on everything from robotics to gaming to advertising and networking. Huang also unveiled an AI supercomputer platform that will help tech companies create their own versions of ChatGPT.

âItâs too much,â Huang said during his presentation of the platform in Taiwan. âI know itâs too much.â

Not everyone is bullish. In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, Cathie Wood, whose flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund cut its holding in Nvidia in January, warned that the computer-chip industryâs boom-bust cycles pose risks. âThere are a few reasons we take some pause,â she said, with competition growing among firms for a piece of the AI market. She called Nvidia a âa check-the-box stock.â

Huang has a knack for riding tech trends â selling graphics chips that powered everything from the video game boom to the rise of cryptocurrency and the industryâs big bet on the metaverse. But arguably no trend stands to benefit his company, today the worldâs most valuable chip company, more than the rise of artificial intelligence.

Last week, the company issued an AI-fueled sales forecast of $11 billion in the fiscal second quarter, blowing Wall Street targets out of the water and growing its value by $184 billion in a single day.

âWe have never seen a guide like the one Nvidia just put up,â Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said at the time.

Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by Huang. It proved more successful than its peers at developing chips that turn computer code into the realistic images that computer gamers love, and rode out a wave of consolidation that saw its rivals acquired, bankrupted or merged into larger companies.

Under Huang, the company then pushed its technology into new markets, such as data center servers and artificial intelligence processing â a move thatâs proving prescient today. In less than a decade, Nvidiaâs data center business has grown from $300 million in annual revenue to $15 billion. The chipmaker has won orders to equip giant computing factories by successfully arguing that graphics chips can handle AI workloads better than more standard processors.

Itâs become commonplace for tech companies to talk up their artificial intelligence prospects during earnings conference calls. References to AI soared after the launch of ChatGPT in November, and they donât always spark a stock rally. But Nvidia has now become the model of a company thatâs actually making money from AI. Itâs the seller of picks and shovels in the gold-rush analogy.

Nvidiaâs success has made investors even gloomier about Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer and the company most synonymous with computer chips. While many chipmakers saw their stocks gain in the wake of Nvidiaâs blockbuster earnings last week, Intel actually fell. Nvidiaâs valuation is now more than eight times that of Intel, despite the company having far less revenue.

The maker and designer of A.I. hardware and software touched the milestone by raising its valuation an astounding $280 billion or almost 40% since May 15, achieving a moonshot virtually unequalled in the annals of capital markets (it closed just below that mark).

But the Nvidia phenomenon has a dark side. It epitomizes the epic, oversize jump in market cap this year for all members of the Trillion-Dollar Club. Indeed, the five members now sporting 14-figure valuations are virtually devouring the S&P 500 index. That's not a good thing. Their synchronized surge is the sole force that's lifted the big cap index this year. And because it's made enterprises that were expensive before their recent takeoff even pricier, it's extremely unlikely that they can carry the the markets higher on their fewer than half a dozen shoulders going forward. Most likely, their valuations are already stretched beyond the max, and bound to snap back. And the ultimate example of the froth that's overtaken the Trillion-Dollar Club is the rise of Nvidia.

The Trillion-Dollar Club accounts for almost all the S&P 500's gains this year

The Trillion-Dollar Club now comprises Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and as of midday Tuesday, Nvidia. From January to May, the group's members have all gained over one-third in value, with Apple stock rising 35%, Microsoft 39%, Alphabet 41%, Amazon 43%, and Nvidia 176%. Apple and Microsoft each added over $700 billion in market cap in the past five months followed by Nvidia ($640 billion), Alphabet ($460 billion), and Amazon ($371 billion). All told, the Trillion-Dollar Club's current members have raised their combined market cap by $2.87 trillion since the start of 2023.

The rub is that the total rise in the big cap index is only a hair more, at $2.98 trillion. Hence, the Club contributed 96% of the year-to-date 9.5% increase notched by the 500 this year. Let's think of the Club as one company we'll call Big Five Ltd. Its valuation jumped by 46.2%, from $6.2 to $9.1 trillion. By contrast, the other 495 cohorts in the 500 posted a combined gain of just 0.3%. Put simply, without the giant lift from the Trillion-Dollar Club, the S&P would be flat for the year, versus posting what Wall Street touts as a strong comeback.

The Trillion-Dollar Club's huge weight is making the S&P 500 lopsided

At the close of 2022, the current Club accounted for 17.6%, or around one dollar in six, of the S&P's total valuation. Today, that number is 25.6%, or more than one dollar in four. In boosting their overall worth by nearly half via adding nearly $3 trillion in market cap, the Big Five have become far more expensive. In five months, their overall P/Eâbased on their total valuation divided by combined net earningsâhas climbed from 27.7 to 40.6, meaning that investors are getting 33% fewer dollars in earnings from every $100 they invest now versus at Christmas of 2022. That current 40-plus multiple, by the way, is almost twice the 23 P/E for the overall S&P 500.

That's especially troubling because since the onset of the pandemic, the Club has already achieved something of an earnings miracle. In 2022, they Big Five garnered around $224 billion in net profits, 50% more than their pre-COVID, 2019 total. So the big multiple comes on top of what could well be unsustainably high profits.

All of a sudden, investors are expecting extremely rapid earnings growth from four already huge, mature companiesâApple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazonâand incredibly fast growth from Nvidia based on vaunting hopes for A.I. The hopes, and the prices, are just too high. Bottom line: Nvidia's rise symbolizes that as the tech giants in the Trillion Club got more and more expensive, they made the index pricier and pricier by gobbling such a big share.

The S&P's comeback this year gets only two cheers. The Trillion-Dollar Club is overperforming, while the rest of the market reflects the reversal of an historic earnings blowout. Soon, the Club will face the same gravitational forces holding back the rest of the market. And when the turnabout comes, it will exert augmented, downward force on the overall index. A few mighty stalwarts can't pull a caravan loaded with laggards forward forever.

663,2023-05-07T18:38:00+00:00,Expedia CEO Calls Out Rival Agoda: How They Get Those Cheap Prices,"Online Travel This Week

You see it everyday on hotel price comparison platforms such as Google: Thereâs the hotelâs official price on its website, and in swoops Singapore-based online travel agency Agoda with a lower rate, thatâs $20 or $30 lower.

That sets up a seemingly ever-present clash of hotel industry rules, where online travel agencies arenât supposed to undercut the rates posted on official hotel websites, versus some metasearch sites and online travel agencies that want to offer the lowest rates possible.

Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern recently called out rival Agoda at Expediaâs partner conference in Seattle as âone of the worst when it comes to this sort of rate abuse.â

âYouâre in a marketplace where one competitor [Expedia] spends every day trying to do the right thing, not perfectly, but is trying, but then another competitor [Agoda] actively tries to do the opposite,â Kern said in a Skift interview at the conference.

Hereâs whatâs going on, as seen in one recent example: A traveler in Singapore can search Google and find a listing for $85 per night from the Hotel du Parc Hanoi on its own website for a June 23-24 stay for a room with a king bed. Agoda has the same room on that night for $20 less, or $65.

In a common scenario, the hotel might have given a private $65 rate to a wholesaler to insert into a vacation package, meaning the room rate wouldnât be readily apparent in this flight-hotel bundle, or maybe it was meant to be a non-public rate for business travel, but then the wholesaler, unbeknownst to the hotel, releases it to an online travel agency.

Hereâs how Agoda.com marketed that rate ($56) before taxes and fees for the Hotel du Parc Hanoi, touting itâs the âCHEAPEST PRICE YOUâVE SEEN.â

Source: Agoda

It takes little work to find these discrepancies. You can find them for Expedia, as well, but Expedia would argue not at the same magnitude as Agoda.

Hereâs another example as seen on Google Hotels for a June 16-17 stay at the Ibis Budget Singapore Sapphire hotel. The hotelâs published rate on its own website is $79, but Agoda has it for $65.

Then-Agoda CEO John Brown detailed his companyâs philosophy on hotel prices at Skift Forum East in 2019 in Singapore. See the accompanying video. (Brown relinquished his CEO duties in 2022, and chairperson role in March this year.)

Source: Skift/YouTube

âIf there is a rate out here for $80 that is bookable by customers around the world and Agoda doesnât have it, I feel like itâs our duty to customers to go off and to get it,â Brown said in the video. âSo whether we will contract it directly with our partners, whether we will connect to a wholesaler etc. We even have something â¦ where we will advance cash and take inventory positions.â

He said Agoda has lots of tools it can use to find these types of cheap rates. âThe bottom line is if the rates are out there, we will do whatever we need to do to put them in the hands of the customer,â Brown said.

A Win for Travelers, A Blow to the Hotel Industry

Brown added that Agodaâs relations with hoteliers âhas not been easy, for sureâ because of these practices, adding that hoteliers have the option to tell wholesalers (who often pass these rates along to Google, Kayak,Tripadvisor, Trivago, Expedia, Booking.com or Agoda) where their rates should appear and where they shouldnât.

Agoda is a Booking Holdings brand, and a Booking Holdings spokesperson defended Agodaâs practices. âAgoda does get many different rates from partners â including wholesale â but they distribute them according to partner agreements,â the spokesperson said. âTransparency with our partners is key.â

Expedia, meanwhile, has skin in the game on this issue on several levels. Expedia has a tech tool called Optimized Distribution to help hotels weed out wholesale and other rates showing up in unauthorized outlets. Expediaâs partners include Marriott, IHG, and others, and it hopes to sign on more.

And, as Kern acknowledges, Agoda is a competitor.

Some point out that Expediaâs hands werenât totally clean when it came to violating hotel rate parity provisions in the past, and Kern said Expedia isnât perfect, but it is trying to make good on pledges to do the right thing.

Kern said heâs amazed that some hotels donât realize how their rates are being mishandled. Sometimes this rate undercutting might only appear from a non-U.S. point of sale, complicating matters for hotel brands that may not be headquartered in that market.

âFrankly, when I talk to major CEOs of major or mid-size hospitality companies, and talk about rate issues, and speak about what optimized distribution can do, almost to a person, theyâll say they didnât realize that,â Kern said, referring to how third parties are misusing their rates.

But you canât just pick companies that make products and services you use and expect to do well. Rather, you want to consider whether the companies behind them actually make money.

Most mornings, I walk three to four miles before starting my workday around 8 a.m. I always stop at my local Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) for a Venti Americano and a quick check of my emails. In one way or another, Starbucks has been a part of my daily life since the early 1990s.

Because I mostly own ETFs to avoid potential conflicts of interest â not to mention itâs much easier to manage ETF portfolios than 20 or 30 stock positions â Iâve never actually held SBUX.

Thatâs my loss, for sure.

Iâve been working for 37 years. Thatâs so long that Starbucks hadnât even gone public when I first started in the business world. The companyâs initial public offering happened in June 1992, selling shares for $17. It raised a whopping $29 million in its IPO and the rest, as they say, is history.

In its 31-year history as a public company, its stock has split 2-for-1 six times, the first in 1993 and the last in April 2015. So, if you bought 100 shares in its IPO for $1,700, youâd have 6,400 shares worth $625,600 today, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. A CAGR of half that amount would be good. No wonder why Howard Schultz is a billionaire.

What Iâve learned about Starbucks over the years is that it always rebounds from adversity. In recent years, this has included labor disputes and Covid-19-related lockdowns in the United States and China, its two major markets. In the latest quarter, U.S. same-store sales grew 12%, while they rose 3% in China, the first positive quarter since fiscal Q3 2021.

Apple (AAPL) Apple Stock Looks Too Cheap Here for Investors to Pass Up

Full disclosure: I own an iPhone, two iPads, an Airbook, a Mac desktop and a pair of AirPods. You could say I like Appleâs (NASDAQ:AAPL) products. However, the companyâs services have contributed to its above-average growth in recent years.

In early May, Apple reported its fiscal Q2 2023 results. Investors expected a dud of a quarter. Instead, it delivered revenue and earnings that beat analyst estimates. On the top line, it generated $94.8 billion, $1.9 billion higher than the consensus, while earnings per share of $1.52 were 9 cents higher than expectations.

Appleâs Services business generated a record $20.9 billion in revenue, up 5.5% year over year. ItÂ includesÂ Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade and is the companyâs highest-margin business segment.

âWe are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,â Apple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook said in the companyâs press release.

Of the 40 analysts covering AAPL stock, 30 rate it âoverweightâ or âbuy,â with a median target price of $183.43, which is 3.5% above its current share price.

On May 23, the company announced a multiyear agreement with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to develop 5G components that will allow it to develop more advanced products with American-made components, part of Appleâs commitment to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years.

Apple is Warren Buffettâs largest equity position by a country mile for a reason.

As a freelance writer, Google Drive is my savior. I use it eight to nine hours each workday for article writing, billing, etc. Iâm sure many of my InvestorPlace colleagues feel the same.

As the parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has spent the last few years working on building revenue streams other than Google Search. Itâs had middling success doing so.

In 2022, Alphabet had revenue of $283 billion. Of that, Google advertising accounted for 79%. Thatâs broken down into three revenue streams: Google Search (72% of Google advertising), YouTube ads (13%) and Google Network (15%). The remaining revenue is split between Google Cloud (nearly 10% overall) and other (a little more than 10%), which includes Google Play, Fitbit, Google Nest, Pixel devices, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.

I can see from the paragraph above, and knowing how I benefit from Alphabet, the dilemma faced by the company. It generates revenue from me from Google Cloud and Google Workspace, and indirectly through Google Search. But, on the other hand, I donât spend much time on YouTube, donât use Google Play, or own any Fitbit or Nest products.

So, how does it grow when other companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon and Apple are nibbling on its ad business? Thatâs the million-dollar question.

However, with the company generating more than $60 billion in free cash flow a year, it has the luxury to think further out.

Thatâs probably one reason Bill Ackmanâs Pershing Square Holdings took a $1 billion position in May.

667,2023-05-07T11:21:00+00:00,Top 15 Offshore Tax Havens in the World,"In this article, we take a look at the top 15 offshore tax havens in the world. For more on this, go to the Top 5 Offshore Tax Havens in the World.

Offshore tax havens offer foreign individuals and companies minimal or no tax liability in an economically and politically stable environment. These havens serve as attractive locations for non-residents who want to minimize or entirely evade tax liabilities without facing any legal complications. They allow foreign corporations and individuals to legally stash their wealth in tax havens and avoid getting taxed in their home countries. Simultaneously, tax havens economically benefit from the incoming capital.

Tax havens donât require foreigners to have a residency in order to park money in the jurisdictionâs financial institutions. They have certain secrecy laws and lax regulations that make it easy for foreigners to stash their money and hide their income from tax authorities in their resident countries.

Recent research reveals that multinational corporations have globally invested a staggering $12 trillion through the utilization of empty corporate shells. Moreover, citizens from financially unstable and oil-producing countries hold a disproportionately significant portion of the $7 trillion personal wealth concealed within tax havens.

While past incidents such as Swiss Leaks, the Panama Papers, and recent disclosures within the offshore industry have shed light on some of the intricate methods employed by multinational firms and affluent individuals to evade their fair share of taxes, the offshore financial realm remains shrouded in opacity. The core services provided by offshore banks, lawyers, and domiciliation companies revolve around secrecy, making it exceedingly difficult to ascertain the exact magnitude of funds channeled through tax havens, their origins, and destinations.

The scale of profit relocation to tax havens is also staggering, with approximately 40% of corporate profits finding their way to these jurisdictions every year. As a consequence, countries such as the US face a significant annual loss of around 16% in corporate revenue to tax havens.

Corporations use several legal means to avoid getting taxed. For example, according to documents filed in the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, in 2017, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) â the parent company of Google â reported $23 billion in profits in Bermuda, a tax haven with a zero corporate tax rate. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) employed the legal Double-Irish-with-a-Dutch-Sandwich technique for the purpose through a Dutch subsidiary. Under this arrangement, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Dutch subsidiary facilitated the flow of royalties earned outside the United States to Google Ireland Holdings, an affiliate based in Bermuda.

By moving intellectual property and licensing it to subsidiaries situated in tax havens, corporations can use the arm's length principle in transfer pricing. This principle ensures that the pricing of intercompany transactions, including intellectual property licensing, resembles what would be expected between unrelated entities in an open market.

As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by offshore tax havens, ongoing debates surrounding the balance between tax optimization, responsible fiscal practices, and the need for global cooperation persist. It remains essential for governments, regulators, and international bodies to work collectively to ensure a fair and equitable tax system that promotes economic growth, stability, and social welfare for all.

Nevertheless, when it comes to stashing your money in offshore bank accounts to minimize tax obligations, there are two crucial factors to consider: confidentiality and accessibility. Thanks to popular culture and media portrayals, you might envision a secretive bank nestled in Switzerland or a secluded island nation in the Caribbean. While there is some truth to this perception, the reality of the world's largest tax havens is far more diverse. These havens are not confined to small nations alone; they encompass major economic powers that may come as a surprise. This article reveals some of them. Top 15 Offshore Tax Havens in the World

Methodology

For our list of the top 15 offshore tax havens in the world, we have ranked them in ascending order based on the Financial Secrecy Index (FSI) 2022 report compiled by the Tax Justice Network (TJN). TJN is a renowned UK-based international network that focuses on advocating and addressing issues related to international tax and financial regulations.

The Financial Secrecy Index ranks jurisdictions based on their level of secrecy and the extent to which they facilitate financial secrecy and offshore activities. It takes into account various factors and indicators, including the level of banking secrecy, financial transparency, and the effectiveness of anti-money laundering regulations.

The Financial Secrecy Index by the TJN is based on three scales; secrecy score, global scale weight, and FSI value. The FSI value combines the secrecy score and global scale weight to indicate the extent of financial secrecy enabled by a jurisdiction.

Based on the FSI value of each jurisdiction, hereâs our list of the top offshore tax havens in the world:

Top Offshore Tax Havens in the World

15. Cyprus

FSI Value: 510

Though Cyprus officially lost its tax haven status in 2015, the island reclaimed its position by ranking 15 on FSI 2022 report, with a financial secrecy score of 62 out of 100.Â  The country has been an attractive offshore tax paradise due to its favorable tax systems, low flat corporate tax rate, and geographical desirability that is in proximity to Russia and Europe.

The island exempts non-resident companies from taxation and also offers various personal taxation exemptions, making it even more attractive to foreigners. For instance, non-Cyprus residents get tax exemptions on employment income, capital gains, dividends, interest, and royalties.

Moreover, foreigners who reside in the country for at least 60 days during the tax year can become tax residents and benefit from tax incentives.

14. Cayman Islands

FSI Value: 516

The Cayman Islands is ranked as the 14th largest jurisdiction with a high financial secrecy value. Known for their tax neutrality and offshore financial facilities such as offshore banking and trusts, these islands make a lucrative haven for residents and non-residents alike.

The islands also favor the incorporation of offshore companies, meaning they are exempted from tax on income earned outside the countryâs territory. This accompanied by the ease of doing business makes the Cayman Islands a popular tax paradise for hedge fund managers, multinational corporations, and American elites.

In addition to this, the Cayman Islands is tax-neutral when it comes to capital gains, income, property, and salesâit has zero tax rates for both citizens and foreigners. However, this notorious reputation has also encouraged various organizations and individuals to perform illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion.

13. United Kingdom

FSI Value: 547

Based on the FSI 2022 report, the United Kingdom ranks as the 13th largest contributor to global financial secrecy, accounting for approximately 1.16% of the global FSI share. According to a 2022 report by the Financial Times, UK residents have held an estimated $1.07 trillion (Â£850 billion) of untaxed wealth in offshore assets. Another report by the Guardian reveals that almost 40% of corporate investment is channeled into tax havens through the UK, making it a major conduit for money outside the UK.

While the United Kingdom may not be popularly recognized as an offshore tax haven, it shares similar characteristics to traditional offshore jurisdictions. For instance, there are no local taxes on businesses operating outside the UK, and dividends distributed through EU member countries are not subject to double taxation.

Moreover, the legal framework within the UK allows the formation of trusts and other financial structures that can be used to hold assets and wealth while potentially evading taxes. These practices, combined with various tax incentives and favorable regulations, have raised concerns about the UKâs status as an offshore tax haven.

12. Netherlands

FSI Value: 556

The Netherlands shares a long history of being an offshore tax haven. It deliberately offers firms the opportunity to become residents within the countryâs territory and enjoy benefits like reduced tax charges on capital gains, royalties, and interest. In 2019, it attracted around $84 billion in foreign direct investment.

Corporate taxes in the Netherlands are quite low, which attracts foreign businesses, making the country one of the biggest recipients of FSI in 2022. It is one of the top European corporate tax havens for American firms that have established subsidiaries in the country to avoid paying US taxes.

11. China

FSI Value: 578

China is not typically regarded as a traditional offshore tax haven due to its strict tax regime and regulations. The corporate tax rate in the country is not attractive, at 25%. The progressive income tax on high incomes is also generally regarded high.Â  However, the 2022 FSI reportâwhich assigns China an FSI value of 578 and the world financial secrecy share of 1.7%âsuggests that the country is considered to have some level of financial secrecy and offshore financial activity.

Macau, a special administrative region of China, is particularly considered a tax haven due to its favorable tax system and policies for both individuals and corporations. In Macau, foreign income is exempted from tax and corporate taxes are significantly lower than in European countries and the United States. It also offers lower tax rates to residents and non-residents settled in the city.

10. Guernsey

FSI Value: 610

Guernsey is the second largest of the Channel Islands, which stands as an independent entity from the UK. The island boasts its own democratically elected parliament, which exercises control over the stateâs laws, budget, and level of taxation. This fiscal and legislative independence empowers the island to swiftly adapt to the ever-changing needs of businesses, enhancing its reputation as an ideal business destination.

Guernsey makes a highly advantageous tax haven for businesses, offering a range of facilities, including a zero corporate general tax rate and exemption from capital gains tax, value-added tax, and inheritance tax. The presence of a variable tax rate further enhances this advantage, frequently resulting in businesses enjoying minimal or even nonexistent tax liability.

9. British Virgin Islands

FSI Value: 621

With a secrecy score of 71 and a worldwide FSI share of 1.83%, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) is recognized as one of the worldâs leading offshore tax havens. Itâs a compliant jurisdiction that has never been blacklisted by FATF or OECD. This, combined with the islandâs subtropical climate and pristine waters, makes the BVI an ideal place for offshore businesses.

The country provides an ideal environment for establishing offshore companies and bank accounts, characterized by zero tax on such entities as well as no tax treaties with other nations. This ensures the secure financial privacy of the companies and account holders, making it an attractive choice for foreigners to protect their assets and wealth.

The BVI also provides tax exemptions on capital gains and profits generated outside the country. Moreover, there are no exchange controls, which makes it easy to transfer funds for investment and trading purposes while maintaining financial privacy.

8. United Arab Emirates

FSI Value: 648

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is among the worldâs fastest-growing tax havens, contributing approximately 1.91% to the global financial landscape. A 2021 report by the Tax Justice Network revealed that over US$200 billion flowed into the country, solidifying its status as an attractive business paradise for foreign investors.

In the 2022 FSI report by the TJN, the UAE surged to number 8 in the rankings, thanks to multinational corporations directing foreign direct investment to the country to benefit from tax savings.Â  The streamlined offshore company formation process and tax-free business model have helped position the UAE as one of the most favorable tax jurisdictions in the world.

However, as part of its commitment to support global tax transparency, the country introduced a 9% tax on corporate gains starting in 2023. Nevertheless, the UAE assures it will remain competitive and attractive for international businesses.

7. Germany

FSI Value: 681

Germany makes it to number 7 on the Financial Secrecy Index 2022. The country not only has a reputation for maintaining the account holdersâ privacy but also offers tax incentives to foreign investors, including zero taxes on interest.

Non-resident corporations are exempt from taxes on dividends or income generated from foreign subsidiaries or branches. Foreign companies operating within Germany also enjoy significant tax benefits, as the countryâs tax environment imposes a tax of only 5% on capital gains and dividends. These favorable conditions make Germany an appealing destination for businesses and investors looking to optimize their tax positions.

6. Japan

FSI Value: 765

Japan is not typically considered an offshore tax haven, but the global financial secrecy share of 2.25% and a secrecy score of 63% indicates a higher level of financial security in the country.Â  It is one of the safest and wealthiest countries in the world with a large market size and business sophistication, attracting foreigners to invest in the country.

Japanâs lenient corporate tax rates, ranging from 15% to 23% in annual income, also position it as a favorable destination for international businesses. Moreover, companies operating within Japan are only taxed on income generated inside its territories, meaning that income earned by non-residents from sources outside Japan is exempt from tax.

Some White House and Commerce Department officials support the strong measures proposed by the European Union for AI products such as ChatGPT and Dall-E, people involved in the discussions said. Meanwhile, US national security officials and some in the State Department say aggressively regulating this nascent technology will put the nation at a competitive disadvantage, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isnât public.

This dissonance has left the US without a coherent response during this weekâs US-EU Trade and Technology Council gathering in Sweden to the EUâs plan to subject generative AI to additional rules. The proposal would force developers of artificial intelligence tools to comply with a host of strong regulations, such as requiring them to document any copyrighted material used to train their products and more closely track how that information is used.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on Wednesday compared advancements in AI technology to social media, noting that in hindsight there should have been more restraint in its development. âThe stakes are a whole lot higherâ in AI, she said during a panel at the TCC meeting.

âJust because you can do it, doesnât mean you should,â Raimondo said. âAnd so as we figure out the benefits of AI, I hope weâre all really eyes-wide-open about the costs and do the analysis of whether we should do it.â

National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said in a statement Tuesday the Biden administration is not divided and is working across the government to âadvance a cohesive and comprehensive approach to AI-related risks and opportunities.â He said the US has been âleading on these issues since long before the newest generative AI products.â

How the EU decides to regulate AI arguably matters more than the debate in Washington. With Congress unlikely to pass binding rules for AI, the European bloc will be the first to dictate how tech giants including Microsoft Corp. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. develop the foundation models that underpin the next frontier of artificial intelligence.

Main Battlefield

These models rely on training data â often large samples of language pulled from the internet â to learn how to respond in various situations, rather then being designed for one specific task. This is the technology behind generative AI, which can respond to homework questions, design a power point or create fantastical images from text prompts.

The question for regulators is who should bear responsibility for the risks associated with the technology, such as the spread of misinformation or privacy violations. The proposed EU rules would add to reporting requirements for companies that develop models used in chatbots, like OpenAI.

Michelle Giuda, director of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy and a former assistant Secretary of State for global public affairs in the Trump administration, said one of the fundamental tasks for the TTC will be to strengthen trust between allies to foster innovation and keep ahead of Chinaâs advancements.

âThe context is that innovation in AI is not happening in a vacuum â all of this is taking place in this 21st century contest between democracy and authoritarianism,â Giuda said. âAnd youâve got technology as the main battlefield.â

High Risk

Until recently, the US and EU had a rough consensus to regulate uses rather than the technology itself, with a focus on high-risk areas such as critical infrastructure and law enforcement.

This approach was enshrined in the USâs non-binding framework for AI systems, as well as the European Commissionâs initial proposals for the AI Act to regulate the technology. The last council meeting in December focused on end-use risk as well.

However, the release of ChatGPT made broader risks more apparent. This month an apparently AI-generated fake image of an explosion near the Pentagon spooked US markets, while the technology has already created corporate winners and losers.

âEurope is important, but this is bigger than Europe,â Commission Executive Vice President Margethe Vestager told reporters at the TTC. She said that, in partnership with the US, âwe can push something that will make us all much more comfortable with the fact that generative AI is now in the world and is developing at amazing speeds.â

The European Parliament has proposed new rules that specifically target the foundation models used for generative AI. Lawmakers in committee agreed earlier this month that more scrutiny should be on the companies that develop these foundation models. Most of those companies, including Microsoft and Google, are based in the US.

Simmering Resentment

This added to already simmering resentment among tech executives over the EUâs antitrust and content moderation rules, which disproportionately affect US companies.

The tech industry has criticized the Biden administration for not doing more to stand up for US companies in the face of what they see as trade discrimination. With the EUâs proposed changes, they warn that the AI Act could go from a bright spot of cooperation to another example of Europe targeting US tech.

The revised AI Act could get a vote in parliament in June, ahead of final negotiations with the EUâs 27 member states.

Dragos Tudorache, one of the lead authors of the bill in the parliament, said after meeting with US officials that âthey consider our moves to also deal with generative AI a good move.â

Some US officials disagree, warning that restricting foundation models could hurt US competitiveness, according to the people involved in the discussions.

Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, became the public face of corporate concern over regulatory overreach when he suggested his company could pull products from the European market if the rules were too difficult to follow. EU Commissioner Thierry Breton responded with a tweet accusing Altman of âattempting blackmail.â

Altman later said he would work to comply with EUâs rules. He will speak with Vestager on Wednesday and meet Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday.

European officials have resisted discussing the specifics of the AI Act with their US counterparts ahead of the TTC meeting, viewing it as inappropriate to bring Europeâs democratic process into a multilateral debate, the people with direct knowledge of the talks said.

The EU is still debating regulation and there are European officials who think the parliament has gone too far, according to some of the people.

Generative AI will be mentioned in the TTC conclusion, according to a draft obtained by Bloomberg. The document affirms the transatlantic commitment to a risk-based approach, but it also highlights âthe scale of the opportunities and the need to address the associated risksâ of generative AI.

Google might not be the problem in your news searches. It could just be you.

A new study found that Googleâs search algorithm does not disproportionately lead people to click on partisan and unreliable news. Rather, people largely click on the news they seek outâno matter where on the internet they find it.

Researchers from Stanford, Northeastern, and Rutgers universities tracked about 600 participants by having them install a web browser extension that followed their activity across the web during two periods: the run-up to the 2018 and 2020 US elections. They were able to compare participantsâ activity on Googleâs search engine relative to their behavior elsewhere on the internet, seeing not only what participants clicked on, but what they were shown by Google.

The study, published in the scientific journal Nature, pushes back against public narratives that the algorithms powering the internetâs most popular websites lead people to misinformation and entrap them in so-called filter bubbles and echo chambers.

âPeople just want to seek out what they want to seek out,â said Ronald Robertson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford Internet Observatory and the lead author of the study. âAnd they use platforms to fulfill their information needs. As opposed to being a naive actor believing and doing what the platform shows them, theyâre actively seeking things out.â

Out of the rabbit hole

As the internet has become more enmeshed in global politics, researchers, critics, and even regulators have become more concerned about the spread of misinformationâand what happens to the news ecosystem when itâs influenced by powerful algorithms that determine what users see and donât see. Meanwhile, political conspiracy theories like QAnon have been born online with no shortage of reports of internet users falling down the internet ârabbit holeâ toward extremism.

But Robertson said that the role of individual agency versus the role of algorithmic culpability hasnât been well probed by independent researchers, and the studies that do exist largely focus on social media and not search engines. (The authors cite a 2015 study finding individual choice was more important than algorithmic filtering in determining whether people were exposed to ideological perspectives they disagreed with on Facebookâbut the authors of that study were researchers at Facebook.)

âDiverse content, diverse choicesâ

The findings of the new study, the authors wrote, donât fully vindicate Googleâs search engine for disseminating unreliable news. âIn some cases, our participants were exposed to highly partisan and unreliable news on Google Search, and past work suggests that even a limited number of such exposures can have substantial negative impacts,â they wrote.

For the Google search study, the researchers relied on an existing database of partisan news sources based on a panel of partisan Twitter users and the web domains they shared. For a credibility metric, they relied in large part on the website NewsGuard, which gives news websites ratings based on their accuracy, quality, and transparency. Robertson called this a limitation of the study, since credibility can vary within a given publication.

Still, the study offers some assurance that weâas internet users and news consumersâhave plenty of agency in discovering and reading news. âItâs quite plausible that Google could just say, we know what kind of news websites you frequent, and so weâre going to prioritize them in our search results; and people might be happier that way,â David Lazer, a Northeastern professor who co-authored the study, told a university publication. âBut they donât. They tend to show diverse content, diverse choices.â

When it comes to AI, it's all about Nvidia

Generative AI is the hottest trend on Wall Street. Ever since OpenAIâs ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, kicking off a flurry of activity in the space, investors have been piling into AI stocks. And Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest winner.

On Tuesday, the company became the first chipmaker to hit a $1 trillion market cap, before settling back below the mark, thanks to a massive runup on its share price after announcing it anticipates second quarter revenue well above Wall Streetâs expectations.

Itâs not just Nvidiaâs earnings, though. The company has been working in the AI space for years, thanks to the fact that the graphics processing units (GPUs) it originally developed for video games also happen to be uniquely suited for running multiple processes at the same time.

That means companies can develop and run algorithms that would otherwise take far longer using traditional central processing units (CPUs). And no other chip maker can match Nvidiaâs capabilities. It provides everything from the chips to the servers to the software necessary to train and deploy AI models.

And because itâs the tech industryâs go-to for GPUs powering AI systems, Nvidia is blowing up like never before. But itâs also put the company at the center of the generative AI hype bubble.

âAs an investor, I get concerned when I see these big jumps,â Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage at a keynote presentation at COMPUTEX. (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

âI think weâre getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the opportunity. But I think that will begin to take shape,â he added.

The future of generative AI is still cloudy

Companies with any ties to generative AI have been on a tear in recent months, as technologists and executives alike promote the technologyâs future potential.

Microsoft, which is investing billions in OpenAI, and Google parent Alphabet, which is rolling out generative AI products of its own, have certainly benefited from the gold rushâ shares of the firms are up 38% and 40% year-to-date, respectively.

Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella says generative AI will upend the search engine business. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai is going all in on the technology, with generative AI touching Google Search and Android. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI is having its iPhone moment.

Those are some heady declarations. And so far, there have been some incredibly interesting use cases for generative AI. Search is certainly one area thatâs set to improve, as evidenced by Microsoftâs Bing and Googleâs Search Generative Experience. Microsoftâs Word and Googleâs Docs also get a nice bit of help from generative AI, as well. MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA - MAY 10, 2023: CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O annual developer conference at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California on Wednesday May 10, 2023. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)

But exactly how those executivesâ predictions play out across the broader economy is still very much up in the air. Part of that will have to do with just how much more productive AI makes us, explained eToro investment analyst Callie Cox.

âWhen it comes to AIâ¦right now weâre in the hype stage. Weâre trying to understand how much of this is real,â Cox told Yahoo Finance Live.

âFor [AI] to be like the second coming of the internet or something that could take hold like the internet did, I think we need to see gains in productivity. Otherwise this could be an exciting technological innovation that fizzles out a little bit earlier than one expected.â

Generative AI is just one type of artificial intelligence that companies across industries are using. Chances are you use the technology today when you get an autocomplete suggestion for an email address or a recommendation while browsing for food on your favorite delivery app. Businesses, meanwhile, use it to predict future sales. In other words, AI encompasses a vast array of technologies.

The hype machine would have you think that generative AI is the be-all and end-all for the category. But thatâs unlikely to be the case in the long term. And while Nvidia will undoubtedly benefit from the continued growth in AI, Wall Streetâs focus on anything related to generative AI could end up being short sighted.

âI think youâll continue to see anything with the generative AI label continue to do pretty well here at least for this year, probably into the first half of next year,â Arone said. âIt wonât be for a little bit until you start to see the wheat separated from the chaff.â

The study, which Apple funded but was compiled independently by Analysis Group, found that App Store sales have skyrocketed 116% since 2019 when the marketplace facilitated $519 billion in sales.

Importantly, the report states, more than 90% of the $1.1 trillion came from sales that did not happen via the App Store itself, meaning Apple didnât collect commissions on them. According to the study, those sales included items such as subscriptions to newspapers purchased on third-party websites, as well as physical goods and services purchased through apps.

In fact, the report states that 81%, or $910 billion, of those total sales came in the form of physical goods and services.

Apple faces intense scrutiny over its App Store practices around the world. The company currently collects between a 30% and 15% commission on app purchases, in-app purchases, and in-app subscriptions.

Regulators around the world, however, have criticized Appleâs policies, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has similar rules around its own app store, and are increasingly pressuring the company to open up its platform to third-party marketplaces or purchase options.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is probing potential antitrust violations related to Appleâs App Store.

The EU, meanwhile, has introduced the Digital Markets Act, which requires Apple to allow third-party app payment options and for users to be able to download apps from third-party stores. Lawmakers in the US have also discussed beefing up antitrust laws to better target Appleâs App Store, but the move has never come to fruition.

The Analysis Group study found that an average of 650 million visitors access the App Store each week, with users downloading an average 747 million apps each week in 2022. The digital storefront, the report found, has 1.2 million apps in total. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.

The vast majority of the $1.1 trillion in sales Analysis Group reported came from general retail sales, which topped $621 billion in 2022. That was followed by travel sales, which hit $102 billion.

China generated the lionâs share of sales last year, the report found, bringing in $570 billion, the bulk of which came from general retail. The US added $273 billion, while Europe and the rest of the world notched $119 billion and $160 billion, respectively.

In addition to overall sales via the App Store, the Analysis Group report also found that Apple has rejected more than 950,000 apps for privacy violations and prevented $5 billion in fraudulent transactions since 2020.

677,2023-05-06T04:00:00+00:00,UPDATE 1-Meta threatens to yank news content from California over payments bill,"(Adds Google request for comment, background on other news payment fights, paragraphs 5-10)

By Katie Paul

NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - Facebook parent Meta Platforms said on Wednesday it would remove news content in its home state of California if the state government passed legislation forcing tech companies to pay publishers.

The proposed California Journalism Preservation Act would require ""online platforms"" to pay a ""journalism usage fee"" to news providers whose work appears on their services, aimed at reversing a decline in the local news sector.

In a tweeted statement, Meta spokesman Andy Stone called the payment structure a ""slush fund"" and said the bill would primarily benefit ""big, out-of-state media companies under the guise of aiding California publishers.""

The statement was Meta's first on the California bill specifically, although the company has been waging similar battles over compensation for news publishers at the federal level and in countries outside the United States.

In December, Stone said Meta would remove news from its platform altogether if the U.S. Congress passed a bill that closely resembles the proposed California legislation.

The company is likewise threatening to

withdraw news in Canada

in response to proposed legislation there, along with Alphabet's Google, which has said it would remove links to news articles from Canadian search results.

The proposals are similar to a

ground-breaking law that Australia

passed in 2021, which also triggered threats from Facebook and Google to curtail their services.

Both companies eventually struck deals with Australian media companies after amendments to the legislation were offered, although the standoff prompted a brief shutdown of Facebook news feeds in Australia in the process.

An Australian government report released in December concluded that the law had largely worked.

Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the California bill. (Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)"

Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith spoke on the fanfare around Nvidia (NVDA) and AI. Smith said, ""I'm going to break this down in three quick letters, it's A M C. At the top, you've got the applications that are going to sit on top of the M, the language-learning models, and at the bottom of it you've got the chips and the data centers.""

KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh discussed Nvidia's advanced software. Vinh said, ""They've got millions of AI developers that are focused on the Nvidia ecosystem and it's really this software ecosystem that's going to give them a sustainable advantage for quite some time.""

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley explained what he thinks gives Nvidia an edge. Howley said, ""People are really talking about how to get their chips at this moment. We're not talking about small firms either. We're talking about the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META) ... Nvidia really is riding this hype train, and they're the conductor.""

Annandale Capital Founder and Chairman George Seay discussed his thoughts on Nvidia and why investors should remain cautious on AI. Seay said, ""Nvidia is going to be a big winner. And I think you've got to look at some of the others like Google and Amazon, some of the other beneficiaries of this movement, and basically spread your bets.""

The company reported first quarter revenues of $72.4 million, more than the $71 million expected on an adjusted loss per share of $0.13, less than the $0.17 loss analysts had expected.

C3.ai's full-year revenue outlook, however, appeared to come in shy of Wall Street expectations. The company said it expects revenue for its fiscal year 2024 to be between $295-$320 million; data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed analysts were looking for revenues closer to $321 million for the full year.

And after AI plays like Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) last week significantly raised their forecasts on a surge in demand, investors appear to be harshly judging C3.ai, with the stock down as much as 20% in pre-market trade on Thursday.

""We believe it is generally agreed today that the market for enterprise AI applications is substantially larger and growing at a much greater growth rate than experts predicted,"" the company said in a statement.

""C3 AI has been at the vanguard of the enterprise AI market for over a decade as that market has developed from its roots in IoT, to unsupervised learning, supervised learning, NLP, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI.""

Despite those assurances, though, investors were't impressed with C3.ai's outlook.

AI is the hottest trend on Wall Street, as companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell (MRVL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) ride the hype wave that kicked off with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.

And while shares of AI darling Nvidia are up 162% since the start of 2023, C3.ai's stock is up a whopping 252%.

Pixxel, founded in 2019, is building a constellation of satellites that have the ability to identify mineral deposits or the productivity of crops by analysing the spectral signature of an image.

Miner Rio Tinto Ltd and Australian agritech company DataFarming are clients, Pixxel said.

The startup has raised more $71 million from investors including Accenture PLC. Pixxel did not specify how much Google had invested or the valuation it reflected.

Google in India did not immediately respond to questions about the investment.

Founder and Chief Executive Awais Ahmed said Pixxel would be ""the most valued space tech company in India after this investment"".

That had been rocket and launch provider Skyroot Aerospace, valued at an estimated $163 million, according to Tracxn, which tracks startups.

""We work with satellite data and Google does a lot of work around that with agriculture and environment,"" Ahmed told Reuters. ""They also have Google Earth ... so a combination of that led to them seeing a benefit.""

Pixxel is among the many private companies looking for a fillip since India opened the space sector, encouraging startups to deliver broadband services like Starlink and to power applications like tracking supply chains.

The government announced its private-sector space policy framework in April.

The funding comes at a time when startups globally have struggled to raise funds. Space startups, in particular, have come under pressure after the bankruptcy of Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit launch company.

Ahmed said the funding would be used to build out its satellite network. Pixxel is readying six satellites for launch next year to add to the three it has now and looking to hire more engineers for its analytics.

Ahmed has said he was inspired to launch a space startup from a visit Elon Musk's SpaceX as part of a student competition to build a demonstration ""hyperloop"" transport pod.

He and co-founder Kshitij Khandelwal set out to build an AI model that could use satellite data to predict crop yields, detect illegal mining and track natural disasters.

They launched Pixxel when they concluded existing commercial satellite images did not provide enough detail. Pixxel's satellites take in and analyse a wide spectrum of light instead of just assigning primary colours to each pixel, a technology known as hyperspectral imaging.

California lawmakers don't trust DMV to ensure big rig safety,"When Teslas are in self-driving mode, they've been recorded crossing into oncoming traffic and hitting parked cars. But what would happen if an 80,000-pound, 18-wheel driverless truck suddenly went off the rails?

That's an experiment some California legislators aren't ready to run. They argue that the state Department of Motor Vehicles has so badly mishandled the driverless car industry that it can't be trusted to oversee big rigs barreling down the highways autonomously.

AB 316 â which would wrest control of driverless truck testing and deployment from the DMV and require human drivers in the cab for at least five years while a safety record is collected â passed in the Assembly on Wednesday. The bill now goes to the state Senate and if passed will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom for his signature.

Its proponents argue that effective laws and regulations depend on shared data, institutional trust and public transparency, and that the DMV is struggling with all three.

""Ultimately, this issue is of such importance and relevance that we can't abdicate our responsibility to the DMV, and the DMV doesn't have the capacity to think about the consequences going forward,"" Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) said in an interview.

In a recent hearing, Laura Friedman (D-Glendale), the head of the Assembly's transportation committee, put it more plainly: ""The DMV has not done a great job at regulating this space.""

DMV Director Steve Gordon did not respond to a request from The Times for comment. In fact, the former Silicon Valley executive has rarely spoken with the media about anything at all since Newsom named him to the post in 2019.

The driverless truck industry, however, has pushed back hard, saying AB 316 would harm California's technological competitiveness. Meanwhile, public debate over the bill is highlighting concerns about safety and job loss, as human drivers of commercial vehicles face replacement by computer systems programmed with artificial intelligence.

How we got here

The Legislature handed driverless vehicle regulation to the DMV when it passed its first bill governing such vehicles in 2012. Hearings held at the time focused on the wonderful future ahead for driverless cars â no more crashes, no more traffic jams.

Autonomous vehicle engineers, including former Google executive Anthony Levandowski, made safety claims that went largely unchallenged. ""Our data so far is showing that the technology is able to drive safer than our trained and professional drivers at the wheel,"" he said.

Because AI vehicles theoretically could drive at high speeds bumper to bumper, ""it'll really clear up the 110 and the 405 and the 710,"" said Mark DeSaulinier, then the chair of the state Senate transportation committee. (DeSaulinier is now a member of Congress.)

Eleven years later, those freeways are as jam-packed as ever. And the safety information on those self-driving passenger cars? It's spotty â in large part because the DMV and the vehicle industry are working to keep key safety data out of public view.

In 2021, after a public records filing by an unidentified individual, the DMV invited Waymo to seek a court injunction to prevent the agency from releasing full crash reports.

After the injunction was granted, the DMV â with the legal assistance of California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta â cut a deal with Waymo to keep the information concealed on the grounds of protecting company trade secrets, according to court records. The deal, approved in Sacramento County Superior Court, allows Waymo to redact most of the details of collision reports as well as information on how the company handles driverless car emergencies, for at least two years.

Although those vehicles, thus far, have not killed or seriously injured anyone in the state, news reports show they can cause plenty of problems on the road: They tend to brake suddenly; block traffic as they pause to decide what to do; cruise through construction zones; and ""brick"" or stall in traffic, requiring a human on the scene to move the car. They've even fled from police.

What Tesla has to do with it

Although the performance of Waymo and Cruise robotaxis operating in San Francisco concerns many legislators â including Friedman â what is especially troubling, they say, is the DMV's relationship with Tesla.

That is ""what really tilted the balance for me"" to support AB 316, Friedman said. At a committee hearing in March, she slammed the DMV ""particularly in regard to one particular auto manufacturer and their overstated promise of what their vehicle actually is capable of doing."" Friedman argued that Tesla's marketing claims are ""leading to confusion from the drivers and purchasers of those vehicles and to lots of tragic accidents that could have been prevented with better oversight from the DMV and [federal] regulators.""

The department allows the electric car company to test driverless technology on California roads without a permit, while other companies are expected to conform to rules that require permits and trained test drivers. Tesla has said that the feature it calls Full Self-Driving is a technology that requires human attention, and doesn't require a permit, according to email records released under California's Public Records Act by the court transparency organization Plainsite.

Meanwhile, the DMV allows Tesla to market this technology package as Full Self-Driving. That name appears to violate the DMV's own rule â now a state law â against marketing cars as autonomous when they aren't capable of fully driving themselves. The DMV said the matter is under investigation, but that investigation has dragged on more than two years.

""The lack of information after two years is deeply concerning,"" said Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach), who heads the state Senate's transportation committee.

When asked about the issue recently, Newsom said he had ""great confidence"" in Gordon and his team. The governor said he's grateful for legislative oversight. But pressed on the specific criticisms aimed at the DMV, he said: ""Forgive me for not being alarmed or shocked.""

What is â and isn't â at stake

The driverless technology industry, centered in Silicon Valley, is opposed to AB 316. ""The economic impact of this bill is going to be devastating, "" said Jeff Farrah, who heads the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Assn., which represents Waymo, Cruise, Motional, Aurora and other driverless car and truck technology companies. ""California will cede its position as a leader in the development of autonomous vehicles to other states that are embracing this life-saving technology at a rapid pace.""

Bill supporters regard such statements as alarmist hyperbole.

""It's easy for people to threaten to leave,"" said Assemblywoman Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D-Winters), co-author of the bill, which is supported by the Teamsters union. ""People aren't going to leave because of this,"" she said, noting the rich pool of technology talent clustered in Silicon Valley. Tesla, in fact, announced in February it would move its Texas engineering team back to California, in part to attract and retain talented engineers.

The industry notes that states including Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Florida already allow driverless trucks on public highways. AB 316 would slow down plans to deploy driverless trucks from Southern California seaports eastward across the country.

The bill would not block driverless truck deployment at the ports themselves or on private property. Asked whether the Port of Long Beach plans to allow testing anytime soon, Anthony Otto, chief executive of the port's container terminal, said no. ""It's completely a safety issue,"" he said.

Aguiar-Curry said for now she's happy to let companies test driverless trucks away from California's highways, citing her constituents' safety concerns.

She also argues that the trucking industry's main concern is not safety but profit.

The business case for autonomous trucks is the vast reduction in labor costs when humans are no longer needed to do the driving. Replacing the estimated 350,000 truck drivers who work in California alone would lead to huge cost savings.

Notably, driverless truck companies are not yet profitable, and cash flow is a big issue. With rising interest rates, capital is harder to come by and the companies need to show progress to attract more investment before their cash runs out. One autonomous truck company, Embark, went bust earlier this year.

Driverless truck companies are funneling millions of dollars into research and development and studies documenting their safety and reliability profile. A recent study from Waymo on collision avoidance suggests the reaction time is quicker for the AI driver than for human beings.

However, as it fights AB 316, the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Assn. continues to make debatable claims about safety.

Farrah has said: ""Autonomous trucks are safer than trucks operated by humans."" Former California Highway Patrol Officer Chris Childs, a paid consultant for the driverless vehicle industry group, recently told legislators that ""in my opinion, autonomous technology is safer than a human driver.""

Although no major crashes involving driverless trucks have been reported, data on whether AI drivers are safer than humans aren't yet able to settle the question. A paper published by the research group Rand Corp. said vehicles may have to be driven hundreds of billions of miles to make the case.

No legislator is alleging that AI-driven cars are necessarily less safe than those driven by humans. They're saying no evidence has been presented, and the technology still has enough bugs to warrant more study, particularly before it's extended to big rig trucks.

Just having an AI semi truck stop dead on a freeway for a period of time could cause major traffic problems, said Assemblymember Laurie Davies (R-Laguna Niguel): ""If something happens on [some stretches of] the 5 Freeway, there's no way of getting around it. What do you do? How long does it actually take to move something like this?""

AB 316 would ""give us the opportunity to find out what are the glitches when we're looking at large vehicles like this, and how we fix them so they don't happen again,"" Davies said.

For its part, the driverless trucking industry argues that the Legislature lacks the expertise to adjudicate the issue correctly.

""The legislation puts the determination for very important safety and fact-based decisions in the hands of the Legislature instead of the able and experienced regulators at the DMV,"" said Mufaddal Ezzy, government relations head for Aurora Innovation, an autonomous vehicle startup.

Waymo head of government relations Annabel Chang said via email: ""If the legislature takes away decision-making power from these experts and creates a complicated political process to approve the operation of autonomous trucks, it will result in indefinitely delayed improvements to road safety and sustainability.""

The experience level of the DMV regulators, however, is thin. The DMV official in charge of driverless car regulation, Miguel Acosta, has no prior experience in vehicle safety regulation or in motor vehicle technology. Before being named to his current job in 2018, he ran customer service for DMV vehicle registration and managed its field offices.

The new service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organizationâs security data across AWS environments. This way, it allows customers to aggregate, normalize and store data seamlessly and enables them to respond to security events faster.

Security Lake develops a security data lake using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and AWS Lake Formation to automatically set up security data lake infrastructure in a customerâs AWS account.

Further, it makes it easy for the security teams to collect, combine and analyze security data as it transforms the incoming security data into the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) open standard.

Customer Base to Expand

We believe that the underlined service will help AWS gain strong momentum among various businesses as it provides a purpose-built data lake that helps in understanding the security posture in a better way, which in turn aids in improvising workloads, applications and data protection.

Notably, customers like Cribl, CrowdStrike, Datadog, SentinelOne, Splunk, Volkswagen Financial Services, Novozymes, Jumia and Wiz have already shown interest in Amazon Security Lake.

We believe that the growing customer momentum will continue to drive AWS's top line.

In first-quarter 2023, AWS generated revenues of $21.3 billion (17% of total sales), which grew 16% year over year.

Bottom Line

We believe that AWSâs strengthening clientele across the world will continue to aid Amazon in gaining a competitive edge against its strong peers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet's GOOGL Google.

Microsoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. The company is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure cloud offerings. Azure's globally increasing number of availability zones and regions, along with strength in its consumption-based business, is likely to continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.

Similarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.

AWSâs growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to keep it ahead of the above-mentioned peers.

Apart from Amazon Security Lake, the company recently introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications.

Further, it unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection.

The company also announced the general availability of AWS Telco Network Builder, which automates the deployment and management of telco networks on AWS.

We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWSâ customer momentum, which, in turn, will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.

Notably, Amazon has gained 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.

695,2023-05-05T09:20:00+00:00,Uber (UBER) Up 0.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Uber Technologies (UBER). Shares have added about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Uber due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Uber Surpass Q1 Earnings & Revenues Estimates

Uber Technologies reported first-quarter 2023 loss of 8 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents. In first-quarter 2023, Uber reported loss of $3.04 per share.

Total revenues of $8,823 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,697.5 million. The top line jumped 29% year over year.

In the reported quarter, the majority (49%) of the companyâs revenues came from Mobility. Revenues from this segment jumped 72% year over year to $4,330 million. Revenues from the Delivery segment increased 23% year over year to $3,093 million. Freight revenues climbed to $1,400 million, down 23% from the year-ago period, due to lower revenue per load and volume,
both due to the challenging freight market cycle.

Total revenues soared 12% year over year to $5,132 million in the United States and Canada. While revenues increased 31% to $565 million in Latin America, the same skyrocketed 86% to $2,094 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Revenues rose 41% to $1,032 million in the Asia-Pacific region. Monthly active platform consumers jumped 13% to 130 million. Â 

Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $761 million compared with adjusted EBITDA of $168 million in the year-ago period.

Gross bookings from Mobility improved 40% to $14,981 million. Gross bookings from Delivery augmented by 8% to $15,026 million. Gross bookings from Freight came in at $1,401 million in the first quarter, down 23% from the year-ago quarter. Total gross bookings ascended 19% to $31,408 million.

Uber exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,045 million compared with $4,208 million at the end of December 2022. Long-term debt, net of the current portion at the end of the reported quarter, was $9,257million compared with $9,265 million at December 2022-end.

Operating cash flow came in at $606 million compared with $15 million in the year-ago quarter. The free cash flow was $549 million.

Q2 Guidance

For the second quarter of 2023, Uber expects gross bookings of $33 billion-$34 billion. The adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $800 million-$850 million.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.

The consensus estimate has shifted 58.67% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

Currently, Uber has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Uber has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Performance of an Industry Player

Uber is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Over the past month, Alphabet (GOOGL), a stock from the same industry, has gained 16.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.

Alphabet reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.

Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of B.

In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Dave Mazza, Chief Strategy Officer, and Matthew Kanterman, Director of Research, at Roundhill Investments, about investing in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

ChatGPTâs astronomical popularity has accelerated the arms race among the tech giants. Nvidia NVDA has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the gold rush as the chip giant is seeing explosive demand for its cutting-edge GPUs used in generative AI applications.

Google dominated the search market over the last few decades, but the launch of new AI-powered Bing by Microsoft has reignited the search war. We discuss what is at stake for these tech behemoths.

Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that generative AI technology could drive a 7%, or about $7 trillion, increase in global GDP over a 10-year period.

The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT) is the first ETF globally to focus on generative AI technology. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet GOOGL and AMD AMD are among the top holdings in the actively managed fund.

ETFs that invest in companies contributing to the development and deployment of AI technologies have seen immense investor interest in the past few weeks.

The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ and the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF ROBO are the most popular products, while the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF IRBO is one of the cheapest funds in the space.

By Zeba Siddiqui

SAN FRANCISCO, June 1 (Reuters) - Hackers have stolen data from the systems of a number of users of the popular file transfer tool MOVEit Transfer, U.S. security researchers said on Thursday, one day after the maker of the software disclosed that a security flaw had been discovered.

Software maker Progress Software Corp, after disclosing the vulnerability on Wednesday, said it could lead to potential unauthorized access into users' systems.

The managed file transfer software made by the Burlington, Massachusetts-based company allows organizations to transfer files and data between business partners and customers.

It was not immediately clear which or how many organizations use the software or were impacted by potential breaches. Chief Information Officer Ian Pitt declined to share those details, but said Progress Software had made fixes available since it discovered the vulnerability late on May 28.

The software's eponymous cloud-based service had also been impacted by this, he told Reuters.

""As of now we see no exploit of the cloud platform,"" he said.

Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 Inc and Mandiant Consulting - owned by Alphabet Inc's Google - said they had found a number of cases in which the flaw had been exploited to steal data.

""Mass exploitation and broad data theft has occurred over the past few days,"" Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer of Mandiant Consulting, said in a statement.

Such ""zero-day,"" or previously unknown, vulnerabilities in managed file transfer solutions have led to data theft, leaks, extortion and victim-shaming in the past, Mandiant said.

""Although Mandiant does not yet know the motivation of the threat actor, organizations should prepare for potential extortion and publication of the stolen data,"" Carmakal said.

Rapid7 said it had noticed an uptick in cases of compromise linked to the flaw since it was disclosed.

Progress Software has outlined steps users at risk can take to mitigate the impact of the security vulnerability.

Pitt did not have a comment on who might have been trying to steal data by exploiting the flaw.

""We have no evidence of it being used to spread malware,"" he said.

MOVEit Transfer was used by a relatively ""small"" number of customers compared to those of the company's other software products that number more than 20, he said.

""We have forensics partners on board and we are working with them to make sure that we have an ever-evolving grasp of the situation."" (Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"
701,2023-05-04T19:58:08+00:00,"Meta tests blocking news content on Instagram, Facebook for some Canadians","OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) â Meta is temporarily blocking some Canadian users from accessing news content on Facebook and Instagram as part of a temporary test that is expected to last through the end of June, the tech giant said Thursday.

The block â which follows a similar step taken by Google earlier this year â comes in response to a proposed bill that will require tech giants to pay publishers for linking to or otherwise repurposing their content online. Bill C-18, the Online News Act, is currently being considered in the Senate and could be passed as early as this month.

Meta also said it is prepared to permanently block news content on Facebook and Instagram for Canadians if the bill passes.

Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez called Meta's move âdisappointingâ and said Canadians will not be intimidated by these tactics.

The temporary block announced Thursday will affect one to 5% of its 24 million Canadian users, with the number of those impacted fluctuating throughout the test, said Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta Canada.

Randomly selected Canadian users will not be able to see or share news content in Canada either on Instagram or Facebook.

The block could include news links to articles, reels â which are short-form videos â or stories, which are photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours.

International news companies including the New York Times or BBC could also have their content blocked in Canada during the test if they are randomly selected.

Meta said it is picking random news publishers that will be notified that some users in Canada will not be able to see or share their news content throughout the test. Users will still be able to access their accounts, pages, businesses suites and advertising.

Legacy media and broadcasters have praised the bill, which promises to âenhance fairnessâ in the digital news marketplace and help bring in more money for shrinking newsrooms. Tech giants including Meta and Google have been blamed in the past for disrupting and dominating the advertising industry, eclipsing smaller, traditional players.

Meta, which is based in Menlo Park, California, has taken similar steps in the past. In 2021, it briefly blocked news from its platform in Australia after the country passed legislation that would compel tech companies to pay publishers for using their news stories. It later struck deals with Australian publishers."
702,2023-05-04T19:49:40+00:00,"UPDATE 1-Meta to test limiting some news access on Facebook, Instagram in Canada","(Updates to add background, details from Meta's blog, and the Canadian Heritage Minister's response)

June 1 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc on Thursday said it will begin tests on its social media websites Facebook and Instagram that will limit some users and publishers from viewing or sharing some news content in Canada.

The testing period will run for several weeks, the social media giant said, adding that the minor percentage of Canadian users enrolled in testing will be notified if they attempt to share news content.

The test comes in response to Canada's proposed ""Online News Act"". Introduced in April last year, the legislation would force platforms like Meta and Google parent Alphabet Inc to negotiate commercial deals and pay Canadian news publishers for their content.

Meta had, in March, warned it would end the availability of news content for Canadians on its platforms if the proposed bill was passed in its current form.

Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez, who introduced the bill last year, called the tests ""unacceptable"".

""When a big tech company... tells us, 'If you don't do this or that, then Iâm pulling the plug' â thatâs a threat. Iâve never done anything because I was afraid of a threat,"" Rodriguez told Reuters.

Google rolled out similar tests earlier this year blocking news content for some Canadian users as a test run for a potential response to the online news bill.

703,2023-05-04T19:22:00+00:00,UPDATE 1-Google leads funding round for Indian space startup Pixxel,"(Updates June 1 story with Google's statement in paragraph 5)

BENGALURU, June 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google is leading a $36 million funding round for Bengaluru-based Pixxel, a satellite-image startup, in the first major investment in the Indian space sector since the government launched its privatisation policy in April.

Pixxel, founded in 2019, is building a constellation of satellites that have the ability to identify mineral deposits or the productivity of crops by analysing the spectral signature of an image.

Miner Rio Tinto Ltd and Australian agritech company DataFarming are clients, Pixxel said.

The startup has raised more $71 million from investors including Accenture PLC. Pixxel did not specify the valuation it reflected.

Google said it had made the investment in Pixxel through its India Digitalisation Fund, which focuses on investment in India-based startups.

Founder and Chief Executive Awais Ahmed said Pixxel would be ""the most valued space tech company in India after this investment"".

That had been rocket and launch provider Skyroot Aerospace, valued at an estimated $163 million, according to Tracxn, which tracks startups.

""We work with satellite data and Google does a lot of work around that with agriculture and environment,"" Ahmed told Reuters. ""They also have Google Earth ... so a combination of that led to them seeing a benefit.""

Pixxel is among the many private companies looking for a fillip since India opened the space sector, encouraging startups to deliver broadband services like Starlink and to power applications like tracking supply chains.

The government announced its private-sector space policy framework in April.

The funding comes at a time when startups globally have struggled to raise funds. Space startups, in particular, have come under pressure after the bankruptcy of Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit launch company.

Ahmed said the funding would be used to build out its satellite network. Pixxel is readying six satellites for launch next year to add to the three it has now and looking to hire more engineers for its analytics.

Ahmed has said he was inspired to launch a space startup from a visit Elon Musk's SpaceX as part of a student competition to build a demonstration ""hyperloop"" transport pod.

He and co-founder Kshitij Khandelwal set out to build an AI model that could use satellite data to predict crop yields, detect illegal mining and track natural disasters.

They launched Pixxel when they concluded existing commercial satellite images did not provide enough detail. Pixxel's satellites take in and analyse a wide spectrum of light instead of just assigning primary colours to each pixel, a technology known as hyperspectral imaging.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Zillow due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

Zillow Group Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1

Zillow Group reported relatively modest first-quarter 2023 results, beating the bottom-line and top-line estimates. Despite recording lower revenues year over year owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment, a favorable mix of first-time home buyers combined with solid engagements in its rental platforms remained tailwinds.

Net Income

GAAP net loss in the quarter was $22 million or a loss of 9 cents per share against a net income of $16 million or 6 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Â  The wider loss was primarily due to top-line contraction and higher operating expenses.

On a non-GAAP basis, the companyâs net income declined to $87 million or 35 cents per share from $121 million or 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 cents.

Revenues

Revenues declined to $469 million from $536 million due to lower Residential and Mortgage revenues owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment. The top line, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $422 million.

The Residential revenues declined 14% to $361 million due to soft housing market conditions. Rental revenues were up 21% to $74 million driven by growth in multifamily properties. Mortgage revenues were $26 million, down 43% due to higher interest rates that slowed refinance activities.

Other Details

During the quarter, Zillow Group recorded a gross profit of $377 million compared with $444 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower revenues. The operating expenses during the quarter were $422 million, up from $408 million in the prior-year quarter.Â  Adjusted EBITDA was $104 million compared with $166 million in the prior-year quarter.

Cash Flow & Liquidity

Zillow Group generated $93 million cash from operating activities compared with $3,392 million in the prior-year period. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $1,394 million in cash and cash equivalents with $133 million of lease liabilities, net of the current portion.

Outlook

For the second quarter of 2023, Zillow Group estimates total revenue to be in the range of $451-$479 million. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $61 million to $81 million.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

Estimates review followed a flat path over the past two months.

VGM Scores

Currently, Zillow has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.

Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Zillow has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

Performance of an Industry Player

Zillow is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Over the past month, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), a stock from the same industry, has gained 18.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2023 more than a month ago.

Alphabet Inc. reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.

However, stock dropped 7% upon the report owed to the fact that capital expenditures were higher than expected.Its shares are under pressure as customers are backing away from consulting deals with the software giant experiencing its slowest pace of growth in 13 years. Salesforce is another tech powerhouse that integrated AI tools into its business, but it is behind its rivals Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google.

First Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended on April 30th,Â revenueÂ amounted toÂ $8.25 billion,Â topping Refinitivâs consensus ofÂ $8.18 billion.Â But the revenue rise of 11% was overshadowed by a 36% rise in capital expendituresÂ that amounted toÂ $243 million, greatly topping by StreetAccount consensus of $205 million.Â The resulting net income amounted to $199 million, or 20 cents per share, rising from last yearâs quarter when it amounted to $28 million, or 3 cents per share.Â Adjusted earningsÂ amounted toÂ $1.69 perÂ share, below Refinitivâs estimated ofÂ $1.61 per share.

Second Quarter Guidance

Adjusted earnings were guided in the range between $1.89 and $1.90 per share on the back of a revenue range between $8.51 billion and $8.53 billion. Analysts gathered by Refinitiv guided for adjusted earnings of $1.70 on revenue of $8.49 billion.

2024 Forecast

With the revenue forecast remaining intact, adjusted earnings were lifted compared to the guidance provided in March. They are now expected in the range between $7.41 and $7.43 per share on $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion in revenue. Refinitivâs poll of analysts guided for a fiscal year revenue $34.65 billion with resulting adjusted earnings of $7.14 per share.Â As CEO Marc Benioff stated, with the operating margin for the quarter significantly exceeding the target, it is now called at 28% for the fiscal year, compared to 27% guided back in March.

Challenges

Chief Operating Officer Brian MillhamÂ noted the trend of clients taking longer to close deals and are looking at them more carefully. Also, professional service businesses are seeing a weakened demand for multiyear transformations as consumers are more interested on quick wins and strategies that bring value as soon as possible. In response, Salesforce is making efforts to automate the sales process and improve the productivity of its salespeople. Chief Financial OfficerÂ Amy WeaverÂ expects those issues to remain.

The AI Race Against Microsoft And Google

During the reported quarter, Salesforce revealed it is following Microsoftâs footsteps as it announced an AI tool its salespeople will use. Einstein GPT is a generative artificial intelligence technology designed to help salespeople, marketers and customer-service agents be more efficient at their jobs. Even the mighty Google got threatened byÂ ChatGPT, as instead of âgooglingâ questions on Google, one can just ask the ChatGPT. Although Google launched Bard AI in response, it was actually one of the first in the conversational game but it missed the boat by launching its own consumer product based on Lamda. Google is hoping to turn things around with Bard which is powered by the language model, but Microsoft is the one troubling Salesforce as besides AI tools, it is its main competitor with Dynamics 365. But, CEO Marc Benioff promises a revelation through Salesforceâs AI-enhanced products that will be added to one of the companyâs most recently acquired assets, the messaging platform Slack.

All in all, Salesforce reported a decent quarter with a profit rise of 68% year-to-date by the market close. With AI claimed to be the companyâs biggest assets, Salesforce promises to be a worthy rival to Microsoft and Google in this arena.

714,2023-05-04T11:25:59+00:00,YouTube to Stop Removing Content Denying 2020 US Election Result,"(Bloomberg) -- YouTube will stop taking down content that promotes false claims about the 2020 US presidential election, marking an about-face by the worldâs largest video site as the next American presidential contest begins heating up.

The division of Alphabet Inc.âs Google said the new policy will take effect on Friday.

âIn the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm,â the company said in a blog post. âWith that in mind, and with 2024 campaigns well underway, we will stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US presidential elections.â

YouTube and other social media companies have been under pressure since the 2016 US presidential election to ensure their platforms are not manipulated to spread political misinformation. YouTube said in December that it had taken down more than 10,000 videos related to the US midterm elections for violating its policies on election integrity and other guidelines. Some of those videos were removed for promoting the falsehood that the 2020 US presidential election was stolen.

YouTube said Friday it would continue to ban content that misleads people about how to vote, advances false information that could dissuade people from voting, and promotes interference with elections. Axios earlier reported the companyâs policy shift.

718,2023-05-04T09:03:34+00:00,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,"Investing.com -- The economic calendar is light in the coming week but rate decisions in Canada and Australia will be in the spotlight in the run-up to the Federal Reserveâs keenly anticipated announcement on June 14. Investors remain cautious despite a rally in tech stocks and market watchers will get an update on the outlook for the global economy. Hereâs what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. data

With the Fed entering its traditional blackout period ahead of its June 13- 14 meeting there will be no officials discussing the monetary policy outlook.

Fridayâs mixed U.S. employment report showed job growth accelerating in May but also indicated that wage gains are moderating. An increase in the unemployment rate added to the view that conditions in the labor market are easing.

The jobs data underlined expectations for the Fed to pause hiking rates at its upcoming meeting. It would be the first halt since the Fed started its aggressive anti-inflation policy tightening more than a year ago.

The ISM services PMI is out on Monday and is expected to point to a still solid rate of expansion, in contrast with the manufacturing PMI which contracted for a seventh straight month in May.

Other reports include Wednesdayâs trade figures and Thursdayâs initial jobless claims numbers.

Stock market gains

Some investors are becoming increasingly wary about how much market gains have come to be dominated by the out-performance of a small handful of megacap stocks while the rest of the market treads water.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has gained 33% so far in 2023 and the benchmark S&P 500 has risen 11.5% year to date, currently standing at a 10-month high.

The combined weight of five stocks - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) - now accounts for 25% of the S&P 500âs market value, with the buzz around advances in artificial intelligence fuelling hopes for significant future gains.

A rally concentrated in a handful of stocks raises questions about the health of the broader market and risks igniting volatility if investors ditch those megacap holdings.

Central bank decisions

Ahead of the Fedâs upcoming meeting the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada will both hold policy meetings this week, as officials in both countries grapple with still persistent inflation.

Tuesdayâs RBA decision could go either way after April inflation data rose much more strongly than expected.

Rates are already at an 11-year peak after a surprise hike last month, with RBA governor Philip Lowe saying he wanted to send a clear message that the central bank will do whatever it takes to win the inflation fight.

Meanwhile, markets expect the BOC to deliver a hawkish hold - indicating that they could raise rates again in July unless there is evidence of cooling inflation.

Eurozone

In the Eurozone, data on Monday will show how the German economy performed at the start of the second quarter, with data on trade, factory orders and industrial production due out after data last week showing that the blocâs largest economy slid into recession in the first quarter.

The European Central Bank is to publish the results of its consumer expectation survey on Tuesday which will show whether inflation expectations are becoming more entrenched.

ECB President Christine Lagarde is to testify before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on Monday and her comments will be closely watched.

Other ECB officials due to make appearances before the central bank enters its quiet period on Thursday ahead of its June 15 meeting include board members Luis de Guindos and Fabio Panetta.

World Bank and OECD global economic forecasts

Investors will get an update on the outlook for the global economy when the World Bank releases its latest projections for global growth on Tuesday, followed a day later by OECD with its own forecasts.

Last month the World Bank warned of a slow-growth crisis in the global economy that could persist over the coming decade amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation, the ongoing effects of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, and three years of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, OECD raised its forecasts for global growth back in March saying it expects global growth to reach 2.6% this year and 2.9% in 2024 but warned that the outlook remains fragile, and risks remained tilted to the downside.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

When Is Debt Dangerous?

Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.

See our latest analysis for Alphabet

How Much Debt Does Alphabet Carry?

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Alphabet had US$11.9b of debt in March 2023, down from US$12.8b, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$115.1b in cash, leading to a US$103.2b net cash position. debt-equity-history-analysis

A Look At Alphabet's Liabilities

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Alphabet had liabilities of US$68.9b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$39.7b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$115.1b as well as receivables valued at US$36.0b due within 12 months. So it can boast US$42.5b more liquid assets than total liabilities.

This surplus suggests that Alphabet has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!

But the bad news is that Alphabet has seen its EBIT plunge 12% in the last twelve months. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Alphabet generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 89% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Summing Up

While it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$103.2b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$62b, being 89% of its EBIT. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.

The company's revenue was up just 3% in the most recent quarter (ended March 31), a sharp slowdown from previous years, showcasing this new macro reality. Does this make Alphabet stock a buy right now?"
723,2023-05-04T07:00:03+00:00,Exclusive: GV promotes 4 new general partners as the firm gears up for âthe next 15 yearsâ,"GV, Google parent Alphabet's independent $8 billion early-stage venture capital firm, has a message for the markets: Theyâre planning for the long haul. The firm is promoting four partners to general partner to take on the wide range of areas GV is funneling cash intoâincluding, of course, generative A.I.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

The firm promoted partners Issi Rozen, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Dame, Brendan Bulik-Sullivan, and Crystal Huang to general partner, they told me. Dame has been at GV since 2018 focusing on consumer tech, and hails from the likes of Uber and Yahoo; Rozen, whoâs been at GV for four years and focuses on biotech as well as GVâs incubation efforts, is a serial entrepreneur who cofounded GV portfolio company Verve Therapeutics and was also a professional jazz guitarist; Huang, focused on tech including fintech and A.I., previously worked at venture firms NEA and GGV Capital; and Bulik-Sullivan, at GV since 2019, focuses on biotech and therapeutics after previously designing machine learning models at portfolio company Gritstone Oncology. Huang and Dame are currently GVâs only female GPs, as former GP Jessica Verrilli departed GV in April.

The promotions bring the roughly 14-year-old firmâs total number of general partners up to 15âwhich, to me, seems like a lot of investors sharing the prized title. But the way Rozen sees it, itâs a market signal and a âvote of confidenceâ in GV: â15 GPs at GV means that we can do really special things over the next 15 years,â Rozen says. He views it as âa long-term horizon commitmentâ to continue to invest. When I asked whether GV is an equal partnership, they wouldnât comment on economics but said that itâs akin to the typical venture firm structure.

The four new GV GPs are split between the firmâs life sciences and digital teams. Huang is tackling generative A.I., and is particularly interested in enterprise use-cases of A.I. geared to compliance and copyright. GV recently invested in A.I. startup Typefaceâs $65 million fundraise, where GV was âa large part of thatâ round, Huang says. Dame, meanwhile, is interested in investing in more womenâs health startups, as well as consumer companies like shopping app Checkmate, where she just invested in the startupâs $15 million May round. Both Rozen and Bulik-Sullivan are spending time looking into and investing in later-stage therapeutics firms, while Rozen notes heâs interested in the latest developments in gene editing.

GV makes on average about 50 deals per year and has announced over 20 deals so far in 2023 (48 including follow-ons, they told me), with âhalf a dozen that will be announced soon,â Dame says.

The move comes at a time when the broader startup and VC market is continuing to wrestle with higher interest rates, slumping funding levels, and anxious LPs. But lucky for GV, they only have to deal with one investor: âThis is the perfect time to have, you know, a stable, visionary LP with a lot of patience and ambition to invest in new emerging tech,â Huang says of Alphabet. And clearly the company isnât letting its foot off the gas in the A.I. war, where the Big Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are battling it out against each other and against open-source entrants.

Huang says Alphabet has been âa super collaborative partner in this effortâ to invest in generative A.I., although GV isnât mandated by the corporate giant to make strategic investments.

Though many founders seem to still be holding out raising fresh funding in an effort to avoid the treacherous market conditions, Dame says sheâs as busy as ever. Huang echoes the sentiment: GVâs digital team altogether is taking upwards of 100 meetings a week.

Deal scoop from Fortuneâs Luisa Beltran: Bond Financial Technologies, which has been up for sale this year, may have found a buyer. Fidelity National Information Services, or FIS, is in talks to buy Bond, according to four banking and venture sources familiar with the situation. Financial terms were unclear and an announcement is not expected anytime soon, the people said. Bond provides software that lets companies of all sorts offer products such as credit cards and debit cards. The fintech raised $32 million in funding in 2020, in a round led by Coatueâs VC fund, Fortune reported. Bond went on the block earlier this year; Goldman Sachs, also a Bond investor, advised on the process, people said. FIS is one of the worldâs biggest financial services companies, with a $32.8 billion market capitalization. News of FISâs interest was reported by Fintech Business Weekly. Bond and Goldman did not immediately return messages for comment. âWe donât comment on rumor and market speculation,â an FIS spokesman said.

725,2023-05-04T00:00:00+00:00,Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Shares of this internet search leader have returned +18.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 17.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $60.21 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $248.34 billion and $274.78 billion estimates indicate +6.2% and +10.7% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Alphabet reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +10.38%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.

In the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $60.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $248.34 billion and $274.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +10.7%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Alphabet Inc. reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +10.38%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Alphabet Inc. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

727,2023-05-03T22:58:09+00:00,Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalioâs Top 10 Holdings in 2023,"In this article we present the list of Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalioâs Top 10 Holdings in 2023. Click to skip ahead and seeÂ Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalioâs Top 5 Holdings in 2023.

McDonaldâs Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalioâs consumer-focused 13F portfolio.

Ray Dalioâs Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.

Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewaterâs AI and machine learning capabilities.

Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaireâs greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Officeâs newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firmâs existing branches in Singapore and the United States.

Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasnât good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.

Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the âHoly Grailâ of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.

In the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewaterâs exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewaterâs exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewaterâs 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.

Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalioâs iconic firm, letâs take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023. Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalioâs Top 10 Holdings in 2023

Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates

Our Methodology

The following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associatesâ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkeyâs research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.

All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.

Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalioâs Top 10 Holdings in 2023

10. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)

Value of Bridgewater Associatesâ 13F Position: $223 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174

The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonaldâs Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.

Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerceâs growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.

Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âWe trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.

We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazonâs position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes >30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.â

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Value of Bridgewater Associatesâ 13F Position: $239 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL)

Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabetâs class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.

As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.

Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âAs we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Googleâs virtual search monopoly.â

8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)

Value of Bridgewater Associatesâ 13F Position: $259 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69

Thereâs been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where itâs understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the companyâs latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.

The Polen Global Growth Strategy isnât as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewaterâs Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:

âWe also liquidated our remaining position inÂ Starbucks CorporationÂ (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more ânormalâ operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucksâ profitability. LâOreal, EstÃ©e Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates theyâre able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.â

7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)

Value of Bridgewater Associatesâ 13F Position: $394 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92

There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Baconâs Moore Global Investments and George Sorosâ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewaterâs Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.

Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.

After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.

6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)

Value of Bridgewater Associatesâ 13F Position: $428 million

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63

Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalioâs top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkeyâs database.

Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. Itâs likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasnât Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.

PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and McDonaldâs Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are three of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalioâs top 2023 holdings. Find out why by clicking the link below.

In addition to tech stocks, dividend stocks are also on investorsâ radars this year due to their ability to generate regular income for them.

âA diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of the stock.â

According to Oxford Economics, global construction output is anticipated to experience a growth of 1.9% in 2023. The primary driving force behind this expansion is expected to be the Asia-Pacific region, which is predicted to observe a construction output growth of 6.4%. Meanwhile, the Americas and Europe are set to experience a contraction in construction output growth of 3.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Over the next 15 years, it is estimated that construction work worth $4.7 trillion will be performed, resulting in a total of $13.9 trillion in construction activity in 2037. This prediction assumes an average annual growth rate of 2.78% during the period.

The long-term expansion in the construction industry is expected to be driven by the growing economic activities in China, India, and the United States. However, in the short term, the construction industry in developed economies is facing a challenging outlook due to high levels of economic uncertainty. There is a strong probability of an economic recession due to high commodity prices and rising interest rates, which have adversely impacted the growth outlook for this year. The tighter monetary policy has limited the buying power of households, leading to a reduction in demand for new buildings for housing facilities. To combat inflation, the US Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates ten times since March 2022. The increase in benchmark interest rates resulted in monthly mortgage payments observing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 38% for a median-price new home in the US, assuming a down payment of 20%. The higher cost of a mortgage has resulted in the demand for mortgages plummeting to a 26-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Experts believe that the residential construction market will remain depressed as the Federal Reserve is expected to increase benchmark interest rates further.

Opportunities for Growth

It is important to note that the construction industry does not face an entirely gloomy outlook. There is a significant backlog of construction work due to supply chain disruptions over the last year, presenting an opportunity for the industry to work on delayed projects and achieve growth. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with the 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, is also expected to result in a reconstruction effort of $1 trillion in the next 15 years. In addition, the growing demand for data centres by leading technology companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is driving large-scale construction projects. Furthermore, public investment in infrastructure projects is also expected to drive growth in the construction industry. Governments are trying to boost their economies following the COVID-19 lockdowns by taking major infrastructure initiatives. For instance, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) revealed in January 2023 that it intends to invest $2.1 trillion to improve the bridge infrastructure across the US. The rising investment is likely to present opportunities for construction companies, resulting in a positive impact on some of the best construction stocks such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN).

The move towards sustainability has emerged as a key theme in the construction industry, driven by the global goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US Federal Government in August 2022 intends to divert $500 billion in federal spending towards cutting down carbon emissions by executing projects that enhance the transition towards cleaner energy and promote sustainable construction. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the construction industry is responsible for using 36% of global energy and contributes 40% to the global carbon emissions. Major production facilities related to the construction industry still use conventional fuel sources for energy, and the global cement sub-industry is alone responsible for 8% of global carbon emissions. These figures emphasize the construction industry's significant role in carbon emissions and its potential for environmental improvement. The public sector, including government agencies and institutions, plays a vital role in driving sustainability initiatives within the construction industry. An example of this is the National Highways in the UK, which has announced that it intends to cut construction activity-related carbon emissions in half by the end of this decade. 10 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On

Hereâs what TimesSquare Capital Management said about Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

âMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), a supplier of aggregates to the construction industry, edged forward by 5%. Its third quarter results were in line with Street estimates. Pricing for aggregates and cement were higher than expected while volumes were strong.

It, too, has surprised us to some extent, with the resiliency that itâs showing in a slowing trucking market. We think thereâs a decent chance that weakness in its end markets will eventually catch up with PACCAR, but we believe the stock is cheap, and its steady parts business will act as a moderate stabilizer in such a scenario.â

As of Q1 2023, 33 hedge funds held a stake in PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR).

Moreover, the company expanded its capital return program by committing to return 60% of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks. Management also raised its share buyback authorization program from $250m to $750m over next 2 to 3 years. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by their production focused Performance Chemicals business, which may lead to margin improvement and FCF generation.â

6. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)

Number of Billionaire Investors: 12

Dollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $284,726,153

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37

âToll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.

At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothersâ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value. If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the companyâs long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothersâ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.â

At Google's request the lawsuit had been moved in August 2021 to a federal court in New York, where other advertising technology cases were being heard.

Texas had asked for the lawsuit to be moved back after the U.S. Congress passed the Venue Act in 2022 that grants state attorneys general the right to choose where an antitrust lawsuit will be litigated.

The Texas lawsuit accuses Google of violating the law by dominating the process that advertisers use to put ads online. Website publishers complain that has resulted in lower revenues.

Google said it disagreed with the decision. ""We're confident that any court will agree that the Texas Attorney General's case is wrong on both the facts and the law,"" a spokesperson added.

The Texas attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In its order, signed by chair Karen Caldwell, the panel of judges wrote: ""On its face, the Venue Act plainly is intended to allow state antitrust actions to proceed in the actionâs original forum.""

The decision was made by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

The case will return to the eastern district of Texas, which has a reputation for being a rocket docket, with quicker hearings and decisions made on cases.

The search and advertising giant, which also makes a smartphone operating system and owns YouTube, faces antitrust lawsuits around the world with most based on abuse of dominance of one sort or another. Google has denied any wrongdoing in how it runs its many businesses.

In addition to the Texas fight, Google is battling the U.S. federal government in two antitrust lawsuits, one based on abuse of dominance of search and the other abuse of dominance of advertising technology. And states led by Utah filed a lawsuit in 2021 saying the company broke antitrust law in handling its play store.

734,2023-05-03T19:09:05+00:00,The Apple Watch gets new features at WWDC 2023,"Apple (AAPL) debuted a number of updates for the software powering its popular Apple Watch during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2023 Monday. Features coming to watchOS 10 include improved watch faces and full-screen displays, redesigned apps like World Clock, and a number of fitness-focused updates.

The features include new watch face colors linked to time â as time changes, the colors on the watch face change too â and a Snoopy watch face. Many of the key features announced were also health and fitness-focused. For cyclists, cycling workouts will now show up as active workouts on your watch and iPhone. For hikers, the watch's Compass app will allow hikers to determine where they last had reception from their carrier. For golfers, there's a feature called Golfshot that purports to help improve their swings â a similar feature is also available for tennis players. Some of the updates to the Apple Watch announced at WWDC.

As executives began talking about health features, they led with mental health and features that allow users to log and track their emotions and take screenings that can help determine whether they need to see a professional. Apple also focused on vision health, including myopia, the condition of nearsightedness â the Apple Watch can now determine how much time you spend in daylight, which can help prevent myopia in children.

In September, at the company's 'Far Out' event, Apple debuted the Apple Watch Series 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra. Apple's increasingly investing in the smartwatch market, which has been steadily growing â by 2025, the number of Apple Watch users is expected to pass 30 million, data from Insider Intelligence suggests.

The Apple Watch is a part of the company's accessories business, which also includes products like AirPods, and generated $41.2 billion in 2022 revenue. Still, that's a minor figure compared to the $205.5 billion Apple generated via iPhone sales that year.

He tells Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita why.

Video Transcript

AKIKO FUJITA: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Major indices red across the board right now, with the Dow seeing the biggest losses with 45 minutes left in the trading day. Down about 156 points. Well, CAPTRUST's Christian Ledoux is back with us to share some stock picks he says are worth eyeing as well some that he's trying to avoid.

So Christian, before the break, we were talking about the huge gains that we've seen in tech, AI being a big driver. Let's start with the pick that you like, Alphabet. Because they got to a bit of a rocky start when it comes to their AI play. What do you like there?

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, two parts, really. The first part being the main business being the advertising model is starting to show signs of recovery. We had about 12 months in the last 12 months of declines in ad growth. And it seems to have stabilized now and is looking promising in the next 12 months.

The other part of it is AI, like you mentioned. And Microsoft made quite a splash with their ChatGPT. And many were suggesting that Google was being left behind. But if you look at Google's most recent developer conference, not as exciting as the Apple conference today, but it was really great to see some of the AI programs that they had in works.

And really, they're going to be more the developer tools that are going to be assisting the engineers with AI. And that's where they're really going to make the money. And it's not going to be about the chat bots as much.

SEANA SMITH: Christian, when you take a look and to account so many of the thoughts out there just on the street, you mentioned how Google has stacked up to Microsoft in their AI initiatives. Do you think then maybe Google is closer to Microsoft with its AI play than many are giving it credit for today?

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Oh, I'd wager that Google is actually ahead in the technology. They've been doing this for decades. So I would imagine they actually have a technological lead. Now it's about packaging and getting products to market, when they didn't anticipate that they would have to get to market so quickly. Microsoft kind of forced their hand. And now that it's out there, I think Google is going to see a nice runway here.

AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about another name that you're liking right now, and that is Jefferies Group. Interesting to note here, this, you also tie to an AI play that you think this could generate a lot of capital markets activity, specifically benefiting somebody like Jefferies. Walk me through your case.

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. Well, first about Jeffrey. So Jeffrey's is sort of an unloved investment bank. They're living in the shadow of Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. But they've come up from the ranks, and they're now the number five in the US and growing faster than all of their leading peers.

But what's really exciting is that when we have a new technology come out like AI is coming out now, what's going to happen real quickly is the venture capitalists are going to sense opportunity for investors in the public markets to want to buy into the trend. And that means they're going to bring a bunch of companies public. And it's going to be companies like Jefferies that benefit from that.

SEANA SMITH: On the flip side, Chris, you have a couple of stocks that you're saying that people should avoid right now. One of those names, American Airlines. And it comes at a time when people it seems like are willing to pay whatever they can to get out there and travel. The demand numbers have looked very, very strong. What's the risk that you see?

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, the strength of travel demand, we've all seen it. We've been to the airports, so we've seen everybody full. And that really actually is the beginning of the negative case on this. It's about as good as it's going to get. We've got about as much capacity utilization in the airline industry as we can handle. We've seen the shortages of staff. And companies like American have had to make deals with their unions to lock in higher costs for those elements of their business.

And then on top of that is the debt that came from the pandemic period. And that debt is a pretty big burden, especially for American. They have the biggest debt load in the industry. And there's some significant maturities coming in '25 and '26 that they're going to have to refinance at likely higher rates. And at the same time, they're probably going to see a downturn in their main business. So that's going to be a struggle for them.

AKIKO FUJITA: So the debt's certainly a concern for American. But is it about the debt more than the industry as a whole? Because to your point, you say it's only as good as it gets. But travel really has reached a peak. You see people shelling out a lot of money, you've seen international travel come back. Hopefully, business travel comes back. I mean, isn't there more upside? And would you be willing to put your money behind some of these other competitors of American?

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: I would not. I believe that the industry is going to have a hard time adding capacity in an economic way. What I mean by that is, the ability to buy new airplanes, get new gates, get new routes, staff those routes at a time when ticket prices are already starting to soften a little bit. So I would anticipate that we are truly seeing about as good as it gets. And by this time next year, we're going to be seeing negative year-over-year growth rates in almost all the metrics.

SEANA SMITH: Chris, the other name that you have that you're telling people to avoid right now is Lucid. Certainly run into its own set of challenges here over the last several months. Selling off just recently last week. Why do you see more downside ahead for Lucid, given the fact that the EV market is certainly starting to heat up?

CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. And it is hard to say negative things about a company that has such a fantastic product. If you've seen their car, it's quite exciting. But what's the problem is that these companies are really having a hard time manufacturing profitably. It took Tesla over a decade from the first production unit came off the line to break into free cash flow profitability.

And the fact that Lucid and it and its peers-- I would say Lucid is in the same situation as all the other EV pure plays-- they are burning cash at a very rapid rate. You saw a couple of weeks ago that they raised additional capital. But that capital at the current burn rate is only going to last for about nine months. They have a little bit more cash in that on their balance sheet, but that's really only going to take them in the 12 to 24-month range of operations.

So they're not likely going to get through the burn for the next few years that people are hoping that they do. And they're going to have to raise additional money in a best case scenario, which will dilute investors. Or they're going to be facing a bankruptcy, which some of their peers are already facing.

AKIKO FUJITA: All right. Christian Ledoux, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate you sticking around."
736,2023-05-03T17:32:55+00:00,Snap hires new head of engineering from Google,"By Sheila Dang

(Reuters) - Snap Inc said on Monday it hired a new senior vice president of engineering from Google, the latest in a string of new recruits to advance its advertising business.

Eric Young, who was previously vice president of engineering for Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud, will oversee the core infrastructure for Snap, which owns the popular photo messaging app Snapchat.

He will also lead efforts to improve Snap's ability to target and measure ads on Snapchat, which was made more difficult by privacy updates on Apple's iOS devices.

While Snap has consistently expanded its audience for Snapchat, which now has 750 million monthly users, the company has struggled to generate revenue at the same pace.

In April, Snap said it was taking steps to simplify how users interact with ads and improve the relevance of ads shown to users, which it said hurt results for some advertisers in the short term.

While at Google, Young worked on building the tech infrastructure for products like search, ads and YouTube.

His appointment at Snap comes after the company hired Rob Wilk, former head of advertising at Microsoft Corp, to become president of the Americas region, as well as another Google executive to lead revenue product.

738,2023-05-03T16:11:35+00:00,A Unique Way To Play The Coming $700 Billion Electric Vehicle Boom,"The global electric vehicle market is a crowded space valued at nearly $194 billion in 2022 and set to reach an astounding $694 billion by 2030.

Now itâs time to find more unique opportunities as many of these smaller car manufacturers find the market being overtaken by the traditional auto giants like Ford, Chevy and GM.

Opportunity abounds, but phenomenal cash burn and a slower path to profitability have rendered this crowded space rather risky.

But the EV market isnât just about the roadways â¦

The waterways are going electric, too, and the playing field is much less chaotic, with the clear first-mover advantage going to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), with its proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor and the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.

The electric boat market is set to grow at a CAGR of nearly 13%. By 2030, this market will be worth almost $15 billion, and it's much easier to navigate.

As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself.

And VMAR has successfully developed the worldâs most powerful marine electric motor, with proprietary technology. First revenues from the PowerTrain are coming this year, along with a second revenue chain in the form of a disruption to the boat rental market.

Sailing legend Ian Bruce is behind VMAR, and unique among EV offerings, the company has zero debt and is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.

Thatâs a good starting point for an electrified market that has few (if any) players who arenât burning cash at an untenable rate.

The Proprietary Tech Powering Clean Boating

The newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries to start this summer.

The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMARâs E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.

That motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.

The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor. With its proprietary technology, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marineâs E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class. Thatâs a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.

Vision Marineâs (NASDAQ:VMAR) E-Motion fully charges overnight with no additional infrastructure, has the highest horsepower engine in its class on the market, offers the first-ever custom design marine battery packs, and it all comes in at a lower cost than any competitors:

Now, itâs all about capturing market share, and thatâs where it gets interesting.

How close are they? Well, the plan is to market the E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received hundreds of advance orders.

And investors will get to see the first revenues from PowerTrain this year already.

Flipping the Switch on the Boat Rental Market

VMAR has a broader vision beyond the most powerful outboard electric motor in its class, too: They also plan to flip the boat rental market and turn it electric.

That $5-billion+ boat rental market (think: thousands of resorts and marinas worldwide) is ripe for flipping, and VMARâs flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.

For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model. By 2024, itâs full speed ahead with scaling.

The companyâs proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQâs most exciting EV plays.

By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.

Zero Debt at a Time of Serious Electric Cash-Burn

This summer should be interesting on the water.

Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) not only has developed the most powerful electric motor solution on the recreational boating market, but itâs also a member of an elite club in this segment that has proprietary technology, zero debt and clear growth runways.

With investors pouring money into anything electric in the wake of a major European push for zero-carbon and the Biden administrationâs clean energy-friendly Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a company that has already staked its claim on the market with a proprietary tech product and is going into its first major expansion push with zero debt has more than just first-mover advantage.

Other tech companies investors should also be taking a look at:

Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT): Applied Materials is an often overlooked powerhouse in the chip manufacturing and research industry. As a leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company designs, manufactures, and sells complex machinery utilized by chip fabs - factories dedicated to semiconductor production. The company is currently the largest chip fab equipment provider in the sector and recently announced its plans to invest up to $4 billion over seven years in the creation of the EPIC Centerâa facility aimed at testing new semiconductor technology and fostering collaboration across the industry. Notable partners expressing excitement about this initiative include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, Intel, and prominent universities such as MIT.

While many chip stocks have experienced significant price surges, Applied Materials has not skyrocketed to the same extent. As of now, its shares trade at a modest 18 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). Although chip fab equipment spending has slowed this year due to economic uncertainties, Applied Materials has adapted by focusing on high-growth segments such as chip fabs for electric vehicles and industrial technology. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 7% rise in EPS year over year.

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL): Regardless of its recent slowdown in revenue growth, Alphabet has seen its shares rise by 40% in 2023, indicating positive market sentiment. The latest data shows that Google Search commands an impressive 92.8% share of the market while Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is gaining traction, outpacing competitors like Amazon Web Services in revenue growth. With a diverse client base and the potential for increased profitability, GCP is poised for further success in the expanding cloud market. Alphabet's culture of innovation, demonstrated by its integration of AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, ensures the company remains at the forefront of technological advancements.

Alphabet's strong financials, including substantial free cash flow and a robust balance sheet, limit downside risks despite global economic uncertainty. With multiple growth drivers, such as digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, Alphabet's diversified revenue streams provide a solid foundation for future growth. Its shares are currently trading at approximately 17 times its projected earnings in 2024, a price that looks attractive with its projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): With a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding. Its services segment, which includes offerings like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has been experiencing remarkable growth, with revenue totaling $20.9 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. This burgeoning services segment not only benefits Apple's financials with its impressive gross margin of 71%, but it also contributes to the company's customer loyalty. The seamless integration of Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, coupled with its vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters a sense of stickiness among consumers, making it challenging for them to switch to competing platforms.

Another compelling aspect of Apple is its proven pricing power, a hallmark of successful companies. Apple has consistently raised prices for its flagship product, the iPhone, without any significant impact on demand. This has helped the companyâs remarkable growth in its gross margin, expanding from 38.5% in fiscal 2017 to 43.3% in fiscal 2022. Additionally, Apple generates substantial free cash flow, amounting to a staggering $111 billion in fiscal 2022. This enables the company to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a dividend yield of 0.5%. As a long-term holding, there are few companies as compelling as this tech giant.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report revealed impressive revenue figures, surpassing expectations and highlighting a compelling investment opportunity. With a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S., Amazon remains the dominant force in e-commerce, bolstered by its unparalleled logistics and distribution capabilities. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holding a substantial 32% share of the cloud infrastructure industry, continues to benefit from the growing demand for on-demand cloud environments.

AWS's remarkable operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's profitability, setting the stage for future expansion. Furthermore, Amazon's digital ads business witnessed strong growth, recording a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in artificial intelligence, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS in April, Amazon is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies. Currently trading at an attractive valuation, with shares down 34% from their 2021 peak, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors seeking a dominant market leader with multiple growth drivers and a focus on AI initiatives.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): This social media giant has seen its shares soar by nearly 120% in 2023, but the stock is still down 31% from its all-time high. The company exceeded Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter of 2023 and, despite already being a dominant organization, it continues to experience growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active people across its Family of Apps. The opportunity to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides the potential for further revenue growth over time.

Reports suggest that Meta may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Furthermore, the company is heavily focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations, boost monetization, and optimize its data infrastructure. These efforts position Meta well for the upcoming technological shifts. Meta's profitability is also worth noting. Over the past five years, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 36.2%, generating substantial free cash flow amounting to $18.4 billion in 2022. This enabled the management team to repurchase $27.9 billion worth of shares last year. With $37 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and long-term debt of $10 billion as of March 31, Meta enjoys a solid financial position.

IBM (NYSE: IBM): This tech giant has demonstrated resilience in its sales growth despite a challenging environment, yet its stock has declined by around 10% so far this year. The companyâs restructuring efforts, including the divestment of its managed infrastructure services segment and the subsequent creation of three simplified segmentsâSoftware, Consulting, and Infrastructureâaim to streamline operations and drive future growth. IBM's constant-currency revenue growth rates have shown improvement this year, indicating a narrowing gap between reported and constant-currency growth rates.

One major area of optimism lies in IBM's cloud business, which is leveraging its subsidiary Red Hat to expand its cloud ecosystem. With a hybrid cloud approach that capitalizes on Red Hat's open-source software, IBM is able to benefit from the cloud market's growth without directly competing against dominant platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Coupled with its expanding portfolio of AI services, IBM is well-positioned for long-term growth. Furthermore, the company's improving margins and rising cash flows, driven by cost-cutting measures and strategic layoffs, provide ample resources for investments in the hybrid cloud and AI sectors.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, just behind Apple, Microsoft's renowned brands such as Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn have secured leading market shares across various tech sectors. This dominance has translated into remarkable stock growth, with shares surging over 800% in the past decade. The company's recent foray into artificial intelligence (AI) has only strengthened its investment appeal. Microsoft's early $1 billion investment in OpenAI has proven prescient, as the AI race unfolds, and competitors scramble to enter the burgeoning market. A subsequent $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year has solidified Microsoft's position as a leader. Integrating OpenAI's technologies across its platforms, including Office, Azure, and Bing, Microsoft has established itself as a go-to provider of AI services. Collaborations with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in AI chip development further exemplify Microsoft's dedication to the field, ensuring optimal performance and effective AI offerings.

In addition to AI, Microsoft has made significant strides in the gaming industry. Despite initial challenges competing against industry giants like Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft found success with the introduction of Xbox Game Pass in 2017. The subscription-based service offers access to a vast library of games, attracting millions of subscribers and transforming the Xbox console into a cost-effective option. The platform's popularity has driven Microsoft's acquisition of prominent game studios to enhance its Game Pass offerings.

Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO): Cisco Systems is a networking giant that develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, telecoms equipment, and other IT services and products. With $23.3 billion in cash and equivalents plus short-term investments, Cisco has the resources for potential acquisitions - an area that could heat up in the second half of 2023. The company is also well-positioned for long-term growth driven by the increasing usage of artificial intelligence software and its focus on shifting towards subscription-based software and services.

Cisco has shown a decent performance in 2023 so far, with a year-to-date rise of around 10%. Although it has lagged behind the broader Nasdaq-100, which saw a 20% increase over the same period, the growth in the company's core networking business and improved supply chain conditions contributed to the positive performance. Cisco has also revised its full-year guidance, anticipating sales growth between 9% and 10.5%, compared to the previous range of 4% to 6%. The company has observed strong new orders, particularly from the commercial and enterprise sectors, with robust demand in the public sector. With a 3% dividend yield, the risk is limited and Cisco is seen by many investors as a strong long-term hold.

Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): Despite experiencing a dip in its stock value in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, the company has shown signs of recovery and is poised for brighter days ahead. In the first quarter of 2023, Shopify reported impressive financial figures, with $1.5 billion in revenue and $116 million in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), marking a year-over-year increase of 25% and 10%, respectively. MRR is particularly significant for subscription-based businesses like Shopify as it provides a stable and predictable revenue stream.

The company's strategic decision to streamline its focus on its core e-commerce software offerings should put it in good stead going forward. By refocusing on its software expertise, Shopify will look to enhance its gross profit margin and allocate resources more efficiently. As a software company at its core, Shopify recognizes that its primary value lies in providing top-notch e-commerce solutions rather than attempting to compete in the challenging logistics industry. With a solid track record and a renewed focus on e-commerce software, Shopify has the potential to deliver substantial value to investors in the long run.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD): AMD presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia dominates the industry, AMD could be a less risky investment option while still providing significant upside potential. The company has the potential to continue capturing market share from Intel in the CPU markets for computers and servers while also challenging Nvidia in the artificial intelligence space.

Another promising aspect of AMD's prospects is its partnership with Microsoft, which is actively purchasing the company's AI-focused MI250 chipset and collaborating on future endeavors. AMD is set to launch its MI300 accelerator processing unit later this year, expected to deliver a significant leap in performance for its data center customers. Similar to Nvidia, AMD is in the early stages of benefiting from AI-driven demand, but it still maintains a considerable discount compared to its previous high. The company's potential for continued market share gains, positive demand catalysts, and partnerships in the AI space positions it favorably for future growth.

739,2023-05-03T16:10:28+00:00,Hacking Spree Feared After Breach of File-Sharing Software,"(Bloomberg) -- Cybersecurity experts are bracing for a potential wave of extortion demands after a vulnerability was discovered in encrypted file-sharing software, a flaw that hackers have already used to target a string of high-profile victims, including British Airways and the BBC.

Several companies and a Canadian province said on Monday that they were dealing with breaches related to the secure file transfer product MOVEit from Progress Software Corp., according to statements from several of the affected entities. The vulnerability allowed hackers to steal files that companies had uploaded to MOVEit, according to Progress.

The flaw had prompted security alerts in recent days from the US Department of Homeland Security, the UK National Cyber Security Centre, Microsoft Corp. and Mandiant, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.âs Google Cloud.

Progress released a patch for the software last week.

âWhen we discovered the vulnerability, we promptly launched an investigation, alerted MOVEit customers about the issue and provided immediate mitigation steps,â spokesperson John Eddy said in a statement.

Microsoft said the hackers responsible for the attacks on MOVEit servers also run the Clop extortion website. Clop is the name of a ransomware variant that has been deployed against companies and organizations around the world, and it also sometimes refers to the hacking gang that uses it. Hackers affiliated with the group also steal data and threaten to publish it on its website if a ransom isnât paid.

The group has primarily targeted the health care and financial sectors and has existed since February 2019, according to Trend Micro Inc. The same attackers were responsible for previous hacks of two other secure file transfer products developed by Accellion Inc. and Fortra LLC, Allan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future Inc.

Publicly available data sources show there are thousands of vulnerable MOVEit servers that could have been affected by the software flaw, Liska said. The criminal hackers are expected to begin contacting companies and demanding payment in cryptocurrency in exchange for not uploading the companyâs stolen data online, he said.

An internet search of publicly visible MOVEit servers preformed by Bloomberg News shows that law firms, health-care organizations and IT firms are among its users.

A representative for the extortion gang said in an email to Bloomberg News that it deleted data stolen from âmilitary, GOV, childrenâs hospitals, police.â It wasnât possible to verify the groupâs claim.

When asked how many companies were breached, the representative replied, âYou all recognize them if they refuse to pay, they will appear on our blog.â

Charles Carmakal, chief technology officer at Mandiant, said the earliest observed exploitation of MOVEit occurred on May 27.

âWeâre expecting the extortion communications to start anytime within the next four weeks or so,â he said. âThere is a lot of data that the threat actor has to sort through. When the extortion starts, it will probably carry on for a few months.â

British Airways, the pharmacy chain Boots and the BBC told thousands of staff that personal information may have been compromised by a cyberattack on their payroll provider, Zellis.

In a statement, Zellis said a âsmall number of customersâ have been impacted. âOnce we became aware of this incident we took immediate action, disconnecting the server that utilizes MOVEit software and engaging an expert external security incident response team to assist with forensic analysis and ongoing monitoring,â according to a statement. British Airways said in a statement that the incident occurred âbecause of a new and previously unknown vulnerability in a widely used MOVEit file transfer tool.â

The government of Nova Scotia said it is investigating the theft of personal information related to the MOVEit vulnerability. âGovernment is working to determine exactly what information was stolen and how many people have been impacted,â according to a statement.

At British Airways, the hack led to the disclosure of employeesâ personal information, including names, surnames, dates of birth and potentially banking details, according to a spokesperson for the carrier, which employs around 35,000 people.

Boots, with more than 50,000 workers, said employeesâ personal details were affected. The server was disabled and staff have been made aware, said a spokesperson for Boots, which is owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

The BBC confirmed it had been affected by the attack on Zellis. A spokesperson said it was urgently trying to establish the extent of the data breach.

âThis is a typical case of a supply chain attack targeting multiple companies at once that hold extremely sensitive data on employees,â said Jake Moore, a UK-based cybersecurity expert and global adviser to the cybersecurity firm ESET. âThe security patch on offer is absolutely vital and should have now been installed by all affected companies to remain protected.â

740,2023-05-03T15:58:14+00:00,How to play the AI tech rally? Hereâs five top stocks in the space,"Investors continue to flock to technology firms investing in artificial intelligence (AI) with the hype further steering market sentiment in the direction of particular stocks which are already making headlines in the sector.

âWhatever your view on Artificial Intelligence, it has certainly captured the mediaâs attention and more companies with exposure to AI are significantly gaining in anticipation that it will lead to productivity breakthroughs and benefits for society as a whole,â Giles Coghlan, chief market analyst consulting for HYCM, told Yahoo Finance.

Coghlan also noted, however, that the issue with any technology as fundamental as the creation of the computer, the internet, or the mobile phone, it that it is almost inevitable that it will lead to a bubble.

âWhile all of these innovations changed the world, early-stage speculations led to huge booms and painful bursts to get there â the challenge for investors is distinguishing the companies that will continue to succeed from those that could end up going bust.â

As a result, he said one potential solution for investors is investing in already top performing firms that have AI exposure.

Here are five of the companies currently dominating the AI space.

Nvidia (NVDA)

The US computer chip designer has become one of the biggest winners of the AI boom, with its stock now worth triple what it was eight months ago.

""Investors have been particularly enthusiastic about Nvidiaâs prospects of late, with stocks soaring more than 110% to date and earnings revised significantly higher, largely due to the fact that its graphics processing units are suited for running AI app,"" Coghlan noted.

Nvidiaâs graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAIâs ChatGPT and Googleâs Bard, making the company a key supplier for companies trying to build something with AI.

âWe view Nvidia as the most important company on the planet in an era that is rapidly changing towards one that will be emphasised by greater AI capabilities,â CFRA research analyst, Angelo Zino, said.

The last quarterly earnings report from Nvidia noted over $2bn in profit in three months. Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11bn in sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 alone.

Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Yahoo Finance that Nvidia is arguably the most high-profile benefactor of the recent AI craze, briefly joining the $1trn market cap club after a massive first quarter that shocked markets.

âNvidia has long been a leading player in the chip business, traditionally making graphics cards for gaming. But the AI revolution has revealed a new use, and it's much more lucrative. Amped-up versions of its chips are essential for powering AI and machine learning systems â ChatGPT, a popular example, runs on Nvidia chips. These next few quarters will be vital, if competitors don't get their acts together, we could quickly see Nvidia build somewhat of a monopoly in this segment, and that's what investors are hoping for,â he said.

Microsoft (MSFT)

When it comes to generative AI, Microsoft is also dominating the conversation after pouring billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The company is adding the technology to everything from its Dynamics 365 to Office 365, and also to Bing. Microsoft is also bringing generative AI to its cybersecurity offerings via its Microsoft Security Copilot.

It's all part of the companyâs strategy to ensure that when it comes to the latest generation of AI, itâs Microsoft that you think of first.

âFor Microsoft, the benefits of AI are broad and should help to offset weakness in other areas like personal computing, which is likely to continue struggling given the pressures on consumers at the minute,â Matt Britzman said.

âBut the purchase of OpenAI opened a new avenue to integrating this technology into the existing office suite of exceptional tools â the result should be broader appeal and pricing dynamics. There should also be benefits for the cloud business as demand for computing power picks up pace,â the equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown also told Yahoo Finance.

Microsoft stock has jumped nearly 40% this year thanks to investor confidence in the group.

The tech giant is also well positioned to become a bigger force in the gaming market with it recently clearing a key hurdle by winning EU approval to acquire Activision Blizzard.

Alphabet (GOOGL)

A head start, however, doesnât mean that Microsoft will stay in the lead forever. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is making big bets of its own, while Facebook parent Meta (META) is building a team of engineers to focus on the generative AI space.

For Alphabet, it has several avenues for AI integration, which Matt Britzman also highlighted to Yahoo Finance.

âThe most obvious is in the core advertising business, where better ad delivery and targeting should boost click-through rates. It'll be interesting to see exactly how Alphabet aims to integrate with search, and we've already seen the launch of an early version of its offering with Bard. But exactly how it can monetise this new way of accessing information without cannibalising existing revenue streams from Google search remains a question â no doubt they'll figure it out,â he said.

Britzman also noted that its cloud offering is another benefactor, recently reaching profitability for the first time with demand for machine learning capabilities on the rise.

âThat's a big milestone for the division that's lagged behind offerings from Amazon and Microsoft,â the analyst added.

Alphabetâs share price has soared close to 40% year-to-date with analysts putting it down to its impressive developments in the AI space.

Amazon (AMZN)

AI has also supported Amazon's success in 2023 with its stock soaring more than 45% year-to-date.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to lead as the biggest player in the cloud market. Moreover, it is implementing AI to its further advantage. However, as Matt Britzman also pointed out, AI at Amazon isn't new.

âIt's been using AI to predict consumer demand and manage inventory levels in the e-commerce business for some time. The real benefit should be to AWS, arguably the main driver of Amazon's valuation. It's the market leader and offers services to help businesses throughout the entire machine learning adoption journey. Growth's been slowing from its mammoth heights, but with AI integration looking like it'll become a must-have rather than a nice-to-have, there's plenty of room to grow,â he told Yahoo Finance.

One of the new ways the company is introducing AI is in its warehouses. It recently announced plans to use the technology to screen items for damage before shipping orders to customers. It has already enforced the AI at two fulfilment centres and plans to roll out the system at ten more North America and Europe sites.

The company said it found the AI technology to be three times as effective at identifying damage as a warehouse worker.

C3.ai (AI)

The AI software developer has also been expanding its artificial intelligence services with the companyâs latest results reflecting that strengthening momentum in its subscription business.

In its recent fourth quarter results, the company beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines but offered a forecast that disappointed Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down 15%.

The company posted revenues of $72.4m, more than the $71m expected on an adjusted loss per share of $0.13, less than the $0.17 loss analysts had expected.

C3.ai's full-year revenue outlook, however, appeared to come in shy of Wall Street expectations. The company said it expects revenue for its fiscal year 2024 to be between $295-$320m; data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed analysts were looking for revenues closer to $321m for the full year.

""We believe it is generally agreed today that the market for enterprise AI applications is substantially larger and growing at a much greater growth rate than experts predicted,"" the company said in a statement.

""C3 AI has been at the vanguard of the enterprise AI market for over a decade as that market has developed from its roots in IoT, to unsupervised learning, supervised learning, NLP, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and now generative AI.""

Despite the assurances, investors weren't impressed with C3.ai's outlook. However, analysts say it remains a key stock in the sector to watch as it continues to play a key role in the AI space. Moreover, since the start of 2023, C3.ai's stock is up a whopping 252%.

Giles Coghlan further noted that while shares in Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, C3.ai and Meta have surged this year, he said all bubbles eventually burst.

âThere is an argument that these stocks still have room to grow â many of these companies justify the recent run-ups, but others (Nvidia and C3.ai) may have surpassed their near-term growth prospects,â he added.

Other stocks to watch

Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are two top stocks in the AI space he is watching â and also warned investors to be âextremely carefulâ and not get carried away by the AI hype.

âRight now, there is no doubt that there is a lot of AI washing taking place which means any company that can add AI to its name is doing that to pump up the valuations.

âFor us, the stocks which are trading at a much better valuation are Meta and Tesla; both huge AI players and they have their own AI chips coming which are going to digest much bigger data and more efficiently,â he said.

The Dalles, however, sits in a high desert. Although the Columbia runs right past it and is filled with more than a million salmon, The Dalles gets only 14 inches of precipitation a year. Two summers ago, the temperature reached 118 degrees. Little more than scrub brush grows around The Dalles, and the Gorgeâs constant west wind blows tumbleweed up against the fence lines in the industrial district. In wintertime, everything hereâthe scrub brush, the ground it grows from, and the volcanic rock that forms the Gorgeâs wallsâare all the same dull matte brown color of stale gingerbread.

With a climate and a landscape unfit for tourism, as the 20thÂ century became the 21st The Dalles found itself on the wrong side of more than just green and brown Oregon. Unlike Hood River, it was still stuck in the old economy. In 1958, Harvey Aluminum had built a hugeÂ smelter in The Dalles. Harvey became a serial polluter, but at its peak the smelter employed one in eight of the cityâs adult population. Like so many American factories, however, the smelter began to falter in the 1980s. After several different owners, it closed for good in 2000. People remember those years here in negative superlatives.

âOur town was dying,â city council member Darcy Long says.

âWe were desperate,â Mayor Richard Mays says.

Then, in 2004, four years after theÂ aluminumÂ smelter finally closed and 199 years after Lewis and Clark first visited the region, a tall man in shorts and an untucked shirt arrived in town and said he was looking for a large industrial tract for his employer.

The agent, Chris Sacca, was circumspect from the start. He would say only that he worked for a company called Design LLC and that the company needed plenty of electricity and a connection to transcontinental fiber-optic cable. Design would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in one-time construction spending, Sacca told city officials, and the facility would produce hundreds of permanent jobs. Design was in a growing technological field, so expansions were likely.

The more local officials learned about the companyâs plans, the more they believed Design represented The Dallesâ chance to exit the dirty industrial world and enter the clean, prosperous gates of the digital age. Of course, Design had a list of items it wanted in return for building in The Dalles. The company wanted property-tax breaksâ15 yearsâ worth, an ask so big it would require the governorâs approval. In addition to power and internet connectivity, Design would also need lots of water to cool its facilitiesâin an arid country, another big ask. Finally, and perhaps above all, Design required total secrecy about the companyâs plans.

The city met all of Designâs conditions, including signing a series of confidentiality agreements so strict that local officials didnât feel comfortable uttering the name of the company behind Design even after the local newspaper had published it. Although Nolan Young left his job as The Dallesâ city manager eight years ago, he still must reassure himself itâs all right to say the name.

âIâd been trained for that word never to leave my lips,â he recalls. âIn the back of my head I have, âDonât say that,â and I have to push through it because Iâve been conditioned not to say it.â

People in the Gorge began to call the new enterprise Voldemort Industries, after the villain in the Harry Potter series, also referred to as He Who Shall Not Be Named. Once the facility opened, you couldnât find it on Google Maps, which was strange: The plant was as big as two football fields.Â The absenceÂ made sense, however, once you understood that the company behind Design was Google, which had chosen The Dalles to build its first-ever company-owned data center.

Nearly 20 years after Google came to town, thereâs no question that economically speaking, the city is better off. The property-tax holiday on its initial data center has expired, and Google is the largestÂ taxpayer in Wasco County, where The Dalles is located, by a factor of seven. ""If they hadnât come, I donât even know what would have happened,â says Long, the city council member.

Itâs equally clear, however, thatÂ the cityâs civic life has materially degradedÂ since Google arrived. Googleâs insular culture recently led to a series of events that peopleÂ both in and out of town describe as âweird,â âtroubling,â and âundemocratic.â When a newspaper reporter asked The Dalles forÂ data aboutÂ Googleâs historical water usage, the city fought for more than a year to keep it secret. As for how much water this high-desert town has promised Google in the future, the city continues to refuse to make that information public.

The secrecy baffles many in the industry because many other tech companies that run data centers routinely share information about those facilitiesâ water needs. Whatâs more, Google hasÂ paid the townâs legal feesÂ to suppress both its current and future water usage, something that experts in corporate/local government relations say theyâve never heard of before.

Such furtive behavior has also leached into the fabric of the townâs everyday life. People here say that while physically in The Dalles, Google is a distant and disconnected presenceâin the town, but not of it. Local businesspeople say that with its own cafeteria and gym, Google produces little of the knock-on business that the smelter once did. ItsÂ localÂ philanthropy, many say, is conducted in a rote, pro forma, and sometimes surreptitious way. Even the incremental business that Google does generate, people say, it generates bizarrely. When traveling contractors come to The Dalles to work on Googleâs physical plant, they refer to the company with code names like OQ, TLK, and Project Triple 12.

Thus, while many people are happy that Google is here because of the tax money and the jobs it provides, theyâre unhappy with how Google behaves. Harvey may have been a dirty employer, they say, but Google is a remote and haughty one.

âItâs a weird situation,â says Jerry Commander, a resident of The Dalles and a graduate of The Dalles High Schoolâs class of 1963. âItâs like thereâs a wall between us and them out there.â

The Dallesâ unusual topography makes it unique among American places. Where else can you find a million silver fish swimming in a huge blue river running through a dun-brown desert? At the same time, ever since the first human beings arrived here more than 10,000 years ago, The Dalles has mirrored the continentâs economic shifts. The region has functioned as a sort of petri dish, a place where we can observe how our economic culture has grown and changed.

Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark west in 1803 to explore âfor the purposes of commerce,â but when they arrived in the Gorge two years later, they found that trade was already flourishing. Here, the mighty Columbia narrowed from 900 yards to less than 50, creating a series of dangerous and nearly unnavigable rapids; later, when the French fur trappers arrived, they called itÂ Les Dalles, their term for a shallow, rocky channel. This chokepoint made it a natural gathering place, because whether going upstream or down, tribes had to stop and portage their canoes around the rapids. After the Cascades snowmelt subsided in late summer, oceangoing tribes from the Pacific traded their seashells in The Dalles with Plains people who had crossed the Bitterroot and Rocky Mountains on horseback to barter their buffalo pelts. As for the local Sahaptin and Chinookan peoples, their local medium of exchange was salmon, which gathered in such quantities at the base of the falls that the tribes dried and traded whatever they couldnât eat. Sometimes they even burned dried salmon for fuel. In the high desert of central Oregon, salmon was more plentiful than firewood.

âThis is the Great Mart of all this Country,â William Clark wrote in his journal in April 1806, and so it remained after EuropeanÂ contact and the removal of tribes to reservations in less productive parts of the Northwest. After Lewis and Clark and the fur trappers came settlers on the Oregon Trail, and then came the sawmills,Â the steamboats, the fruit orchards, and the salmon canneries. In the late 19th century, the Union Pacific built a railroad along the Columbia, and in the 1940s, dams downriver at Bonneville and upriver at Grand Coulee powered the factories and shipyards that built the ships and planes that won World War II.

Whether conducted by canoe, steamboat, or hydroelectric dam, water has always powered the regionâs economy. Because itâs so valuable in the high desert here, water has also been central to many of The Dallesâ most serious conflicts. Whiskey is for drinking, the saying goes in dry parts of the West, but water is for fighting. In 1957, the U.S. government built a dam just upriver from The Dalles, flooding Celilo Falls and the other ancestral fishing areas of the native tribes. Although it never had as dramatic a drop as Niagara, before the dam buried it underwater Celilo Falls was the nationâs biggest waterfall as measured by volume. More than 65 years after the event, the fallsâ inundation remains so offensive to the regionâs tribes that they canât agree on whether to commemorate its place in their history. Twenty years ago, a nonprofit group commissioned Maya Lin to build seven installations along the Columbia River to explore the history of contact between native tribes and Europeans, but so far, the group has managed to build only six. The last one, planned for Celilo Falls, remains disputed. âSome people donât want it,â says Antone Minthorn, a member of the Cayuse tribe whoâs been involved with the project. âThey think the damage was so bad that we should not honor it.â

The dam, however, did bring cheap hydropower to the region, which in turn drew Harvey Aluminum to The Dalles in 1958. Like most industrial operations, Harvey was hard on the environment. Shortly after the smelter opened, Harvey and the regionâs cherry growers were pulling roughlyÂ three times more water from the cityâs underground aquifer than normal precipitation could replace. The state declared The Dalles one of its first critical underground water areas, and the federal government had to intervene to stop the aquifer from being sucked dry. Later, cherry growers sued the smelter when fluoride coming from Harveyâs smokestacks damaged their orchards. Over time, the factory site became so polluted that in 1986 it was added to the Superfund list, the nationâs official roster of toxic waste sites.

The smelter, however, did employ a lot of peopleâmore than 1,000 at its peak.Â Today, Googleâs data centers in The Dalles employÂ only 200.Â TheÂ Fred Meyer supermarket and the local cherry growersâ cooperative both have more full-time workers here than Google does.

Techâs failure to replace most of Americaâs manufacturing jobs is not Googleâs fault, nor the fault of any tech company. Itâs just the way the digital economy works. Techâs products are zeros and ones, and very few people are required to run what amounts to a virtual world. Nobody makes anything in a data center; like tech in general, itâs capital intensive rather than labor intensive. Digitization, in fact, represents the most ruthless substitution of capital for labor the world has ever seen.

That was obvious from the beginning with Google and The Dalles. After Googleâs first data center opened in 2006, it built another one next door in 2015Â and a third in 2018,Â both of which received tax abatements that wonât expire until the next decade. Still, Googleâs data centers are so valuable that even with only its original facility onÂ the rolls, Google contributes an enormous amount to the local tax base. In 2022, Google paid $5.4 million in property taxes, seven times more than Union Pacific, the countyâs second-largest taxpayer. When the tax breaks on Googleâs expansions end in the 2030s, the company could be paying as much as a third of The Dallesâ current $90 million annual budget.

The jobs that Googleâs data centers have produced are certainly cleaner than the smelterâs wereâbutÂ like tech in general, theyâre not as environmentally friendly as its leaders want us to believe. Although Alphabet, Googleâs parent, routinely ranks near the top of American corporations on ESG metrics, data centers use about 2% of the nationâs electricity. Thatâs more than cryptocurrency miners use. Data centers also rank in the top 10 American industries in terms of water use, becauseÂ without something to cool the thousands of computers, all the electronics would simply melt.

Researchers at Virginia Tech estimateÂ that data centers consume 130 million cubic meters of water annuallyâless than steel mills and oil refineries but more than fertilizer or concrete manufacturers. These numbers are almost sure to grow exponentially, simply because our desire for computational capacity is growing exponentially. Artificial intelligence cannot run without data centers like Googleâs in The Dalles, and an A.I. language-processingÂ model built in 2020 uses 600,000 times more computing power than one built in 2012.

Until Google began talks with the city on a third expansion, water availability had never been an issue.Â While it gets little rainfall, and while environmental laws forbid it from using the Columbia,Â The Dalles can access 10 million gallons of water a day through both its aquifers and in Cascade basin watersheds above the Gorge. About five years ago, however, Google began to talk with the cityâs public works department about its increasing water needs. After conducting three studies, all of them paid for by Google, The Dalles determined that while its 10-million-gallon water supply was currently adequate, over time it might need as much as 17 million gallons a day.

Working with Google, officials at The Dalles devised a water and sewer infrastructure expansion plan which seems like a good deal for the city. Under it,Â Google will pay $28 million to upgrade the cityâs water and sewer system and drill new wells so The Dalles can access unused aquifer water rights. Google also will give the city water rights it acquired when it bought part of the old Harvey Aluminum property. In return, The Dalles has committed to tap more water in its Cascade watersheds and inject the water into its aquifer during the snowmelt for the dry summer months. Overall, the plan will roughly double the cityâs water capacity at almost no expense to The Dalles, officials say. There will be more than enough water for everyone, including Google.

Environmentalists and tribal groups worry about the effects of development along the Columbia and warn that the expansion could generally stress the ecosystem. âThe problem is death by a thousand cuts,â says John DeVoe, senior advisor toÂ WaterWatch,Â an Oregon conservation nonprofit. However, even critics of the water plan concede that it poses no imminent threat to the environment. Certainly, The Dalles region is far from where it was two generations ago, when the smelter and the cherry growers nearly sucked the local aquifer dry.

The plan itself, however, has never been the problem. The problem has been the fight to keep the key data secret.

The battle began innocuously enough. As the city council prepared to consider the water expansion plan in September 2021, a business reporter atÂ the Oregonian named Mike Rogoway asked the city for Googleâs water usage the previous year. That same day, city attorney Jonathan Kara denied the request. The information, he said, was exempt from Oregonâs public records law because it contained Google trade secrets that the city had promised to protect in confidentiality agreements it had signed with the company.

âI was quite surprised when the city said no,â Rogoway, whoâs been covering technology in the state since 2004, recalls in an interview. âIâd asked about water use of Apple and Facebook in Prineville and Intel in Hillsboro and never had any problems.â

Several days later, the city council met to consider the infrastructure plan that its staff had negotiated with Google. Some found themselves in a very embarrassing and very public position: While city administrators knew how much water Google was using and how much the city had promised it in the future, some council members did not. On the last page of the 26-page water and sewer upgrade plan, city officials had blacked out Googleâs maximum future call on the cityâs water supply.

Some council members asked for the data at the meeting, but city attorney Kara made the same argument he had made about Googleâs historical water data usage: It was a trade secret and protected from public view.

The politicians tabled the issue. âAt this point, nobody has enough information to make any kind of decision,â council member Long said at the meeting. âWe all deserve to know whatâs in this agreement. Thatâs their job as a corporation, to look out for themselves. And we should be looking out for ourselves.â

Long tellsÂ Fortune that Kara later showed her the water-usage data, but only after she signed an individual nondisclosure agreement. The implication, she says, was that she would be personally liable if she made the figures public. Kara declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege, but Long says her impression was that the city attorney shared the information only after clearing it with Google. âIt was definitely my understanding that this was with Googleâs knowledge,â she says. âHe wasnât doing anything they didnât know about.â

In November, the council met again, and this time, all members knew how much water The Dalles had committed to supply Google. Their constituents, however, did not: Some were upset about it. âAs a homeowner in The Dalles and as a voter in a democracy, it seems incredible to me that you would have entered into a special agreement with Google to withhold their water usage because they want it held as a trade secret,â Christine Psyk wrote in an email to the council before the vote. âItâs extremely condescending and patronizing to take the stance that voters donât have a right to know how a big company in their own town intends to use a public resource.â

Although some council members agreed with Psykâs position, they unanimously passed the water expansion plan. âIt would put a lot of our residentsâ minds at easeâ if Google disclosed the data, city council member Dan Richardson said at the meeting. â[But] the people that do need to know them do know them and feel pretty good about them.â Steve and Cindy Nimmo at their business, Raindrop Laundry in The Dalles, Oregon. The couple says the complex has generated little incremental business for them. Robbie McClaran for Fortune

Meanwhile, Rogoway atÂ the Oregonian pursued Googleâs historical water usage. Following Oregonâs rather byzantine system to appeal the denial of its public-records request, the newspaper asked Wasco County district attorney Matthew Ellis to order The Dalles to make the data public. Shortly afterward, Ellis agreed with the paper that the data was not in fact a trade secret. âNothing about water use gives away the design or actual use of the water, just the amount,â he wrote.

ExpertsÂ Fortune interviewed agree with this line of reasoning.Â âThereâs not a lot of engineering trade secrets in data centers,âÂ one former data-center executive for a large cloud company says.Â â[Amazonâs] AWS and [Microsoftâs] Azure can pretty much figure out what Googleâs doing just by inference and vice versa. Thereâs nothing really secret about them.âÂ At its huge data center complex 80 miles east of The Dalles, Amazon, the market leader in cloud computing, hasnât asked authorities to keep its water usage from public view. When Rogoway atÂ the Oregonian asked local officials for Amazonâs water usage there, they quickly provided it to him.

The Dalles, however, fought the newspaper for more than a year over Googleâs historical water figures. Then, in late 2022,Â it abruptly settled the lawsuit and agreed to divulge them. In an interview with Fortune, Mayor Mays says the city was prepared to keep fighting to keep the data from the public. It stopped, however, because Google told them to.

âIt was out of the blue,â he recalls. âThey said, âThe hell with it.ââ

Around this same time, Google publishedwater usage for its 15 American data-center sites. A Google spokesperson said in an email that the company did so after concluding that its server-farm portfolio was diverse enough that publishing site-specific water data wouldnât give away how much computing capacity each data center had. Other people, both in and out of town, believe it had more to do with the desire to end the bad publicity around The Dalles controversy, which had begun to be reported in the national media.

Whatever the reason, experts who study interactions between small towns and big corporations say that while the dealings between the two are often one-sided, the relationship between Google and The Dalles is unusually dysfunctional and lopsided.

âIt really is one of the more egregious instances of corporations and public officials colluding to keep really important information about public resources away from the public,â says Pat Garofalo, director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project, which works to reduce corporate influence in politics and the economy. âSecrecy has been normalized to such an extent that corporations try to keep things hidden that are patently ridiculous.â

The cityâs assertion that there will be plenty of water for everyone may be true, but itâs impossible to verify. Michelle Wilde Anderson, a law professor at Stanford University who specializes in legal issues involving smaller local governments, points out that Google paid for the studies on how much water the city could provide. The consultants who do these studies, she says, work regularly for Google but not for The Dalles. âThey compete for Googleâs business, but the town is a one-off,â Anderson says. âThey have an incentive to tell Google what they want to hear on projections of both use and availability.â

If Googleâs water-usage data were public, Anderson says, independent experts could study the plan in full detail, and the townâs citizens could trust their government. âYou have to do these things with sunshine, not because Google is nefarious and the city council is incompetent,â she says, âbut because water rights are incredibly valuable, and the townâs continued existence is incredibly important.â

Perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that Google has been paying the cityâs legal bills to keep the data from public view. As part of its confidentiality pacts with the city, Google has agreed to reimburse The Dalles for any legal expense it incurs to protect whatever Google asserts is a trade secret. To date, according to city attorney Kara, The Dalles has invoiced Google more than $215,000 for its legal bills.

Such an arrangement, experts tellÂ Fortune,is unprecedented. âIâve been on this issue since 2008 and I havenât seen that happen elsewhere,â says Garofalo.Â âIâve never seen this before, and itâs very weird and troubling to me,â says Anderson.

Meanwhile, The Dallesâ legal tab with Google remains open, because the key data pointâGoogleâs maximum future call on the cityâs waterâremains secret. So far,Â the Oregonian has failed in its legal attempts to make The Dalles divulge those blacked-out figures in the cityâs infrastructure upgrade plan.

Experts struggle to explain why Google has insisted that its water-usage data is a trade secret. Garofalo thinks Google wants to conceal the data to hide how wasteful it is. Anderson thinks that more information equals more debate, which equals more time, which Google canât afford in its race to become a major cloud company.

Steve Lawrence, who was mayor of The Dalles from 2013 to 2019, has a more general explanation. âHereâs what Iâve experienced with Google,â he says. âThey will try at every corner to not tell you whatâs going on. I think itâs the Google mentality. They donât want to tell anyone any more than they have toâand I think that comes from the top.â

I had come to The Dalles because I wanted to find a delta region, a place where the receding waters of the industrial economy were giving way to the fresh rush of the digital age. A friend who works at a major tech company told me that The Dalles was such a place.Â In The Dalles, he said, I could find people in flannel shirts driving pickup trucks next to tech bros in chinos driving BMWs.

This turned out to be untrue. During my time in town, I met city officials, lawyers, librarians, bartenders, grocery clerks, waiters, laundromat owners, and a former bareback horse and bull rider who now runs a gymâbut I never met anyone who worked inside Googleâs gates. Google didnât allow me to tour the data center or interview its executives, and the spokesperson who responded to my questions did so only after I promised not to name her or quote her directly. Some of the local people I met gave me the names of a half dozen current and former Google employees, and I reached out to them by text or LinkedIn. But I never heard back from any of them.

Many people, even ones whoâve lived here since Google first came to town, get the same sense of eerie absence. When Steve Lawrence was mayor, Google asked him to sign a release before visiting the company cafeteria, and he never got close to the data center itself. Jerry and Loretta Commander moved to Alaska in the late 1960s so he could work on the pipelines there; they retired back to their hometown around the same time that Google opened its first facility. While they know plenty of people who work in Googleâs food service, security, and maintenance operations, they know only one person who works in the actual data centerââand we get around,â Loretta says.

Part of this is simply math. Because Harvey Aluminum employed roughly five times more people than Google does, it was easier to know someone who worked at the smelter. Itâs also about the precise composition of Googleâs workforce: The Commanders donât know many people who work inside the data centers themselves because not very many people work in them. Google designed the complex so that it could control the nerve center in The Dalles using software and engineers at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.

âIt didnât matter whether you have 500 or 500,000 computersâyou could run them remotely,â Jim Reese, who oversaw Googleâs initial data-center efforts, told Steven Levy for his bookÂ In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives. âWe need physical hands only to get computers in place and replace the hard drives and motherboards when they fail. Even at the point where we had 50,000 computers, there were maybe six of us maintaining them.â

Because its product is metaphysical, perhaps itâs no coincidence that Google has a hard time relating to people in the actual, physical place it chose to build its first data center. Google, people in The Dalles say, handles the town the same way it handles its data: remotely, abstractly, in a way that feels only somewhat real and human.

The Commanders, for example, remember when Harvey Aluminum used to sponsor Little League teams in the summer and basketball teams in the winter. It had a float in every local parade, and when the Commanders graduated from The Dalles High School, the smelter threw a party for them as it did for every graduating class. The couple remember spending the night at the park inside the factoryâs fence line, playing softball and miniature golf and swimming in the employee swimming pool. Harvey, they say, understood the importance of a public gesture, even ones that conveyed the companyâs power in town. Once, when payday came, Harvey paid everyone in silver dollars so that people could see the smelterâs money circulating through The Dalles like so many salmon in the Columbia River.

Googleâs leaders, the Commanders and others say, engage in none of this old-fashioned corporate signaling. There are no Little League sponsorships, no baseball caps, and none of the boosterism that Harvey Aluminum excelled at. As a result, Loretta Commander says, âit still feels like theyâre some distant company instead of right here on the outside of town.â

Steve and Cindy Nimmo agree. While they can see the steam rising from Googleâs cooling towers every morning at 6 a.m. when they open their Raindrop Laundry Service in a strip center on a little rise above the industrial district, the Nimmos say the complex has generated little incremental business for them. What bewilders the Nimmos more, however, is how the traveling electricians and welders behave when they visit Raindrop Laundry to clean their hot suitsâfire-retardant coveralls and leggings that protect them from steam, chemicals, and electrical flashes. While Steve suspects that these contractors work for Google, they continue the long tradition of refusing to utter the companyâs name.

âUsually they say, âWell, I work out at that place Iâm not supposed to talk about,ââ Nimmo says with a gentle shake of his head.

âSecrecy has been normalized to such an extent that corporations try to keep things hidden that are patently ridiculous.â

Pat Garofalo, director of state and local policy at the American Economic Liberties Project

Josh Molnar, who opened Muscle and Fitness Center on the corner of 8th Street and Garrison in 2005, has also seen little knock-on business from Google. He has also experienced secretive behavior from its itinerant contractors. As a former professional rodeo rider, however, he is franker than Nimmo about how he feels about it.

âThey tell me things like, âI work for Project Triple 12,ââ Molnar says. âI say, âBullshit! Project Triple 12âyou work for Google! Why donât you just say it?â Itâs insulting. When a company comes in, especially a big company like Google, why would you hide what youâre doing? Youâre supposed to be part of the community.â

The Google spokesperson says that using code names is standard practice in the construction industry. Business owners in Prineville, however, 115 miles south of The Dalles on the Columbia Plateau, say that the contractors who work at Facebookâs and Appleâs data centers in that town make no secret of it. Nimmo says that in The Dalles, Google is the only major company to use code names. âWhen mechanics on the wind turbines come in, they tell us theyâre with GE or whoever,â he says. âThatâs something we can put our finger on. But with Googleâ¦â

Such cloak-and-dagger behavior has led to all sorts of rumors about what Google's up to in town. Most of them are of the wild-eyed, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory variety: Google buses workers in daily from Portland. It flies them in by a jet that lands on the airstrip across the river in Washington. Google wants to buy up a good part of the cityâs housing stock. While few people in The Dalles take these stories seriously, Lisa Commander, Jerry and Lorettaâs daughter, argues that the rumors are a natural consequence of Googleâs choice to shut itself off from the town.

âItâs the classic game of telephone,â she says. âBecause Google doesnât communicate, someone hears something and passes it along, and you donât know what to think.â

City leaders like former mayor Lawrence defend Google, saying that the companyâs record of charitable giving is strong. âTheyâre really great partners here in town,â he says. But even his fellow politicians concede that Googleâs philanthropy is so understated that instead of projecting modesty, the company instead projects aloofness. Darcy Long, the city council member, says that when she asked Google for some computers while doing work for a local nonprofit, Google donated themâbut only on the condition that the group not tell anyone where they came from.

âI talked to some of the Google people about it, and it had to do with the whole corporate secrecy thing,â she says. âMaybe they thought everyone would ask them for computers if they knew we were getting some. I donât know. Iâm sure people ask for them anyway.â

Instead of Little League sponsorships and parade floats, Google publicizes its community engagement in a two-page brochure it publishes around the year-end holidays. If you squint hard, you can see white doves, Christmas wreaths, and blocky Stars of David. âAs part of our commitment to the region, weâre excited to share that Google has contributed more than $1 million to nonprofits, schools and other organizations in Oregon, with a focus on Wasco County,â the brochure begins. It highlights charitable donations to help fight food insecurity; $100,000 for a water pilot project on Fifteenmile Creek, an important salmon and trout tributary; and the same amount to support âa service center for low-income families including those experiencing houselessnes [sic].â

The brochure itself is attractive, with many of the vaguely religious symbols deeply saturated in red and set against an equally saturated background of dark blue. But in my two weeks in The Dalles, I never saw a real copy circulating in a public place. I didnât see one at the public library, for example, or at the post office or inside City Hall. Instead, a city official who wanted me to know about Googleâs record of charitable giving emailed me the brochure as a PDF. Like most of the town, I experienced Googleâs good works virtually rather than tangibly.

If you approach The Dalles through the Gorge from the east, you will be traveling the same route Lewis and Clark did when they first arrived here in the autumn of 1805, but you will encounter a very different landscape than they did. The tribes have all been moved away to reservations, and the narrows and the rapids that gave The Dalles its name have been submerged thanks to the more than 400 dams built in the Columbia River Basin. Today, the Columbia is so wide that it looks less like a river and more like a series of long and tranquil lakes; in wintertime, ice forms on the Columbiaâs banks. The interstate and the railroad now parallel the river, and wind turbines, maintained by mechanics who drop their clothesÂ at Raindrop Laundry Service, line the bluffs of the Gorge. The Gorge, the wind, and the gingerbread brown scrub brush, in fact, are likely the only phenomena that Lewis and Clark would recognize today.

They certainly would not recognize Googleâs dull, anonymous buildings in The Dallesâ industrial district. Water vapor from their cooling towers evaporates into the evening sky, creating what Googleâs website calls âa quiet mist at dusk.â If it werenât for the tumbleweed against the fence line and the Gorge rising up along both sides of the river, the data centers could be an auto-parts plant in Kokomo, Ind., or a slaughterhouse in St. Joseph, Mo. But nobody is making or killing anything inside Googleâs data centers. They are giant, modern granaries. They store the stuff of our lives and send it back to us at two-thirds the speed of light whenever we want it.

When big factories came to town in the industrial era, their domination was overt. Two hundred miles northeast of The Dalles, in Washington, DuPont built a dynamite plant in 1908 on old Nisqually tribal lands. The company then built homes, a butcher shop, a hotel, a playground, a school, and a church around it. The factory operated until 1975 and produced more than 1 billion pounds of explosives. Naturally, the town was named DuPont.

Since it came to The Dalles, Google has behaved in almost the exact opposite way. It quite literally didnât want to be on the map. At the same time, it wants a lot more water to cool its servers. How much, only a few people know.

âThe underlying thread of this whole saga is that very few people have access to the detailsâjust a couple people, a handful of people,â says Long. âWeâve been all aware of big corporations screwing the little guy, and when youâre worried something doesnât smell right and you canât get the data, of course people push back. âTrust meâ is not a great response.â

Lisa Commander agrees.

âItâs almost,â she says, âlike weâre becoming a stealth company town.â

(Reuters) -Want a New York hotel near a Christmas market, a vegan restaurant, or another attraction?

Look no further than artificial intelligence from Google at Priceline as early as this summer, the companies told Reuters.

The online travel agency, part of Booking Holdings, aims to debut a more sophisticated chatbot for planning trips, as well as hotel suggestions that are like ""a personal concierge"" tailored to users, said Martin Brodbeck, Priceline's chief technology officer.

""You can easily find out that in Bryant Park there's a Christmas market that runs from early November all the way through the beginning of January when you're actually booking your hotel,"" he said.

New tools from Google's cloud division give Priceline access to generative AI, like the technology behind ChatGPT that can draft text as if a human wrote it. The tools also extract information such as hotel prices from existing data to ensure accuracy.

For Google, drawing business through AI represents a potential way to close the gap with rivals Amazon and Microsoft, as it has long been a distant No.3 provider of cloud services like data storage.

For Priceline, the embrace of novel technology on its website may help it vie with myriad platforms that market travel options, some of which are exploring how consumers react to AI.

Its rival Expedia Group has said ChatGPT would power conversations on a smartphone app. That is giving travelers ""inspiration on places to go"" and booking options, said Rathi Murthy, its chief technology officer.

Both Expedia and Kayak, another site owned by Booking Holdings, have integrated their travel suggestions through features in the standalone ChatGPT program as well.

And Google itself has long represented competition for Priceline, though Brodbeck said its cloud capabilities were what led to the partnership.

The ability to build applications atop generative-AI that Google pioneered has attracted recent business, said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO.

""There is a kind of a Cambrian moment happening now where there's an explosion of this technology,"" Kurian told Reuters, referring to the extraordinary prehistoric period when a wide array of new species emerged.

He declined to answer how free corporate previews were affecting Google Cloud's profitability.

Google's AI will generate coding suggestions for hundreds of software developers at Priceline, said Brodbeck. Priceline will adopt Google's search capabilities for employee intranets. And Google's AI will speed up marketing for trending destinations.

""You could have it create images like a beautiful beach, and you could marry that with great generative-AI copy,"" Brodbeck said.

The U.S. economy has undergone several shocks over the past couple of years. This turmoil started after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019 which led to lockdowns and a broader downturn in economic activity in 2020. The slowdown led to investors fleeing away from the stock market due to the potential impact of lockdowns and stay at home orders on general productivity. They, however, returned back in droves after it became clear that the technology sector would be the biggest beneficiary of the chaos.

Then, as the world wearily looked towards normalcy in 2022, the after effects of expansionary fiscal policy during the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine dealt a massive inflationary blow to the economy. This blow led the Federal Reserve - which had initially mistaken the inflation as transitory - to aggressively increase interest rates in an attempt to curtail economic activity and reign in the beast of inflation.

Yet, as if all this wasn't enough, 2023 started off with another crisis a.k.a. the debt ceiling. The specter (and spectacle?) of a default by the largest economy in the world almost scared the daylights out of both government officials and investors. Thankfully though, this crisis is over as legislation in Capitol Hill to raise the debt ceiling cleared Senate and Congress in June 2023.

With the debt ceiling out of the way, the only worry that remains is that of a potential recession. The Federal Reserve is quite optimistic that it can avoid this outcome. However, its fight just took a complicated turn in June when the labor data for May 2023 came in. This data shows that in May, 339,000 new jobs were added to the economy, smashing Wall Street estimates of 195,000 out of the park. Yet, at the same time, the unemployment percentage of 3.7% surpassed estimates of 3.5% - making sure that the latest report remained stuck smack in the middle when it comes to looking in the crystal ball to see what the Fed might do in its upcoming meeting later this month. Top Rated Stocks Billionaires Love

Amidst this chaos, some economists pointed to the upcoming data for the consumer price index (CPI) figures due in the second week of June, and others shared that don't be fooled to believe that a recession is on its way. This voice belongs to the chief economist of the financial research firm FWDBONDS LLC who shared with Bloomberg:

Donât be fooled by the jump in the unemployment rate from the April 3.4% best and lowest since the 1960s to 3.7% this month, along with the Household Survey saying employment actually fell 310K in May, this labor market is strong as a bull and the economy is miles away from the cliffs of recession. ... Whatever you want to call it, be patient, watch and wait, pause, or skip a meeting, the Fed canât afford to pass on a rate hike at the June meeting as the labor market is just too darn strong. If you believe in economics textbooks at all, the labor market is too tight despite the odd three-tenths increase in the unemployment rate today. Skip it and kick the can down the road for another meeting later on this year is just bad policy. Bet on it.

Even then, as most folks struggle with inflation, hedge funds are busy making money. And as they say, to make money, you have to spend money. And despite the turmoil in the financial market, the funds are out with the big bucks. Just how big? Well, some are eager to guarantee top stock investing talent a stunning $120 million in payouts

As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.

On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.

So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.

However, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.

Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.

So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:

Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.

Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firmâs results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.

In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.

The S&P 500 was up 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, or 36 points lower, and the Nasdaq gained 0.4%.

Financials were the top performing sector on the day, led by regional banks including U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) and East West Bancorp (NASDAQ:EWBC) as investors appear keen to buy into the weakness seen in the spring.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), meanwhile, helped push tech stocks higher though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued to trade in the red after unveiling its Vision Pro headsets on Monday.

The higher-than-expected price of $3,499 for the headset could limit adoption and any meaningful boost to revenue in the near term, according to UBS

â[W]ith a starting price of $3,499, roughly $500 above our expectations and an availability date in early 2024, we estimate the impact over the next 12-18 months will likely be no more than 1%-2% of total revenue,â UBS added.

Health stocks were pressured by a slump in Elevance Health Inc (NYSE:ELV), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN), with the latter down more than 4% as it continues its fight with regulators to save the deal to acquire cancer startup Grail.

Illumina Inc (NASDAQ:ILMN) on Monday appealed against a Federal Trade Commission order that demanded the company to unwind its $7 billion acquisition of Grail.

Boeing (NYSE:BA), a major dow component, was also big drag on the market falling 2% after the aircraft maker said it would delay deliveries of its 737 Dreamliner jets, citing a production flaw.

In crypto-related news, the regulatory heat turned up a notch as the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) accusing the cryptocurrency platform of breaking U.S. regulations, sending its shares more than 12% lower.

The move comes just a day after the SEC sued Binance, alleging multiple security violations including misappropriating customer funds.

Cryptocurrencies, however, sidestepped the regulatory worries as Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), ETH/USD and XRP led the broader crypto move higher.

By Jeffrey Dastin

June 6 (Reuters) - Want a New York hotel near a Christmas market, a vegan restaurant, or another attraction?

Look no further than artificial intelligence from Google at Priceline as early as this summer, the companies told Reuters.

The online travel agency, part of Booking Holdings, aims to debut a more sophisticated chatbot for planning trips, as well as hotel suggestions that are like ""a personal concierge"" tailored to users, said Martin Brodbeck, Priceline's chief technology officer.

""You can easily find out that in Bryant Park there's a Christmas market that runs from early November all the way through the beginning of January when you're actually booking your hotel,"" he said.

New tools from Google's cloud division give Priceline access to generative AI, like the technology behind ChatGPT that can draft text as if a human wrote it. The tools also extract information such as hotel prices from existing data to ensure accuracy.

For Google, drawing business through AI represents a potential way to close the gap with rivals Amazon and Microsoft, as it has long been a distant No.3 provider of cloud services like data storage.

For Priceline, the embrace of novel technology on its website may help it vie with myriad platforms that market travel options, some of which are exploring how consumers react to AI.

Its rival Expedia Group

has said

ChatGPT would power conversations on a smartphone app. That is giving travelers ""inspiration on places to go"" and booking options, said Rathi Murthy, its chief technology officer.

Both Expedia and Kayak, another site owned by Booking Holdings, have integrated their travel suggestions through features in the standalone ChatGPT program as well.

And Google itself has long represented competition for Priceline, though Brodbeck said its cloud capabilities were what led to the partnership.

The ability to build applications atop generative-AI that Google pioneered has attracted recent business, said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's CEO.

""There is a kind of a Cambrian moment happening now where there's an explosion of this technology,"" Kurian told Reuters, referring to the extraordinary prehistoric period when a wide array of new species emerged.

He declined to answer how free corporate previews were affecting Google Cloud's profitability.

Google's AI will generate coding suggestions for hundreds of software developers at Priceline, said Brodbeck. Priceline will adopt Google's search capabilities for employee intranets. And Google's AI will speed up marketing for trending destinations.

""You could have it create images like a beautiful beach, and you could marry that with great generative-AI copy,"" Brodbeck said. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto, Calif.; additional reporting by Doyinsola Oladipo; Editing by Sonali Paul and Chizu Nomiyama)"

The Alphabet Inc. unit is enabling more users in India to access its services with their local language, by either writing or using their voice, Sanjay Gupta, head of Google India, said Tuesday. The company has been developing an artificial intelligence model that would be able to handle more than 100 Indian languages across speech and text, a drive that would widen internet access beyond the countryâs urban English-speaking minority.

âTo me, thatâs the biggest investment that weâre making as Google,â Gupta told a news conference. âTo enable this content revolution, is to enable every Indian to use the internet as deeply as English users did five years back.â

The Mountain View, California-based companyâs Android operating system dominates the Indian market, while Apple Inc. is making a push in more expensive smartphones. Google has made efforts to solidify its position in mass-market phones, launching affordable devices such as those through its partnership with billionaire Mukesh Ambaniâs Reliance Jio.

âWe today have one of the lowest data costs in the country, but the next 300 million users will require a much cheaper smartphone,â Gupta said.

The South Asian nationâs internet economy is set to expand more than five-fold to about $1 trillion by 2030, according to a research report from Google, Temasek Holdings Pte and Bain & Co. That surge is expected to be driven by e-commerce, online travel bookings, food delivery and ride-hailing.

""Last year, Generative AI came into its own with the launch of DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and then finally ChatGPT. ChatGPT caused the most hype â probably because it was the first time a layperson could use AI and see the results firsthand. It racked up one million users within five days of launch.

One of the early narratives around ChatGPT was how it would disrupt Google Search because it gave users direct answers that they didnât have to dig for themselves. And if Google pivoted to this model and users didnât have to click on links, there would be no way for them to monetise by selling ads.

758,2023-05-02T21:31:30+00:00,12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,"In this article we present the list of 12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Click to skip ahead and see theÂ 5 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are some of the hottest stocks on the market this year, which is likely of little surprise to their bullish hedge fund shareholders, which own each of them in significant quantities.

Stocks are off to a strong start in 2023 as they look to rebound from an underwhelming 2021 and an even poorer 2022. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has gained 11.9% this year on the heels of 19.5% losses in 2022, while the NYSE is up a more modest 1.3% after 11.5% losses last year. The biggest winners though have been tech stocks, as the Nasdaq has soared by 26.9% year-to-date following a 33.1% decline in 2022.

Thatâs left no shortage of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, with several of their top 10 most popular stocks all delivering big returns this year, while the majority of stocks on this last, all of which have gained at least 30% in 2023, rank among their 30 most popular stocks. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks occupy most of the spots on this list, with AI being a key theme that is driving many of their results to new heights or expanding their capabilities in exciting ways.

To determine which hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, you first need to know how to find out what hedge funds are buying. Insider Monkey specializes in exactly that, publishing dozens of articles quarterly on the latest hedge fund activity according to their most recent 13F filings with the SEC, in which hedge funds with more than $500 million in assets under management must disclose their holdings.

Insider Monkey also compiles the quarterly ownership data from a select group of 900+ top performing funds to create industry and other theme-specific lists of what stocks hedge funds are buying now, so investors can get a quick snapshot into how some of the brightest minds in the investment world feel about the prospects of companies compared to their rivals in various industries and sectors.

Critics sometimes point to the fact that any list of the hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is already outdated by the time their holdings data becomes available, given that most hedge funds donât disclose their holdings until the 13F filing deadline approximately six weeks after the date on which theyâre reporting their holdings. However, given their general focus on long-term investing, this criticism is relatively unwarranted and makes them the ideal investors to piggyback for anyone whoâs looking to build a portfolio of diversified assets with great long-term potential.

Thatâs not to say we donât see significant swings in hedge fund ownership of certain stocks each quarter, as just a single event or earnings report can dramatically alter the long-term outlook for companies. In other cases, some of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds see slight declines in ownership in the following quarter(s) simply because theyâve been doing so well and may have reached a valuation point that has surpassed the fair value estimates that some funds have on those stocks.

With all of that in mind, letâs check out 12 hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds, which have enriched their shareholders with at least 30% returns this year. 12 Hot Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds

The following list of the hottest stocks to buy according to hedge funds are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment and include only the most popular stocks among hedge funds which have posted at least 30% gains year-to-date.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the first of several semiconductor stocks to make the list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds thanks to its dominant position in the high-performance chip market, where it currently controls close to a 90% share of the global market. As the demand for top-of-the-line chips intensifies in the coming years thanks to the expected robust growth in AI and cloud computing applications, Taiwan Semiconductor appears poised to continue its impressive growth and further grow its already-strong margins.

Wedgewood Partners likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)âs long-term growth outlook, as relayed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedÂ (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Companyâs customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Companyâs aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.â

11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 73

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 34.5%

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have rallied this year after a miserable 2022 that saw them lose 46% of their value. While they still have a ways to go to make up all of those losses, their 38.2% gains year-to-date have convinced several hedge funds to go long MU, including Rajiv Jainâs GQG Partners, which bought nearly 4.3 million MU shares in Q1.

Despite recently being banned in China when it comes to certain critical infrastructure projects and installations, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares have outperformed even TSMâs this year, gaining 35% year-to-date. According to Bernstein analyst Mark Li, the impact of the China ban should be relatively negligible for Micron in the grand scheme of things, as Micronâs enterprise segment accounts just 20% of overall revenue, with Chinaâs portion of that likely accounting for as little as 2% of overall revenue.

Claret Asset Management noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) shares had lost nearly half their value through the first nine months of 2022 in the fundâs Q3 2022 investor letter:

âInflation is still higher than interest ratesâ¦ not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality:Â MicronÂ reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.â

10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 289

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 40.2%

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the most popular stock among hedge funds in terms of single-ticker ownership (Alphabet has more hedge fund shareholders combined between its two tickers) and it hasnât disappointed smart money managers this year, returning 36% year-to-date. Unsurprisingly, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest MSFT shareholder with 39.3 million shares. Its 13F portfolio has 31% exposure to Microsoft.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is taking some intriguing steps to eat into Googleâs search dominance, having recently integrated its own search engine Bing into the AI chatbot ChatGPT, a move that was facilitated by Microsoftâs earlier $13 billion investment in the AI platformâs creators, OpenAI. The tech giant is also gaining a strong foothold in the cloud computing space, as Azure is slowing gaining market share on Amazonâs AWS.

Alger Spectra Fund discussed the latest AI innovations at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âMicrosoft CorporationÂ (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate Americaâs transformative digitization. Microsoftâs CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAlâs ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. Contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the companyâs portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoftâs investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.â

9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOGL)/155 (GOOG)

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 41.2%

Hedge fund ownership of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) peaked at the end of 2021 with nearly 400 long positions in the companyâs class A and class C shares being held by hedge funds (some of which owned both classes). That was followed by a 6.9% drop in ownership during the first-half of 2022 and another slight dip in the first quarter of this year.

Considering the broad questions facing the long-term viability of Google Search in the age of AI, as outlined in the Microsoft writeup above, itâs perhaps somewhat surprising to see Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares up 41% this year. That said, the effect of ChatGPT/Bing on Google Searchâs market share has been negligible thus far. In fact, Googleâs market share rose by 20 basis points to 92.8% in April compared to December 2022, when ChatGPT was first unleashed. And while Search undoubtedly remains the companyâs bread-and-butter when it comes to ad revenue, it also has a strong cloud division that grew revenue by 28% in Q1, while YouTube remains the worldâs dominant streaming platform with more than 2 billion monthly active users.

The Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy detailed why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one of its strongest Q1 performers in the fundâs Q1 2023 investor letter:

âWe did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon,Â Alphabet Inc.Â (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.â

8. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 44.4%

Shares of SaaS workflow platform operator ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) have shot up by 38% in 2023 as the company continues to grow its business at an impressive rate. Hedge funds may be getting concerned about the stockâs valuation, as their ownership of NOW has ticked down slightly for three straight quarters, but it nonetheless remains one of the 30 most popular holdings among smart money managers.

ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is also turning to AI to bolster the digital transformation suite of services that it offers clients, including recently launching an AI collaboration with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the hottest stocks on the planet in 2023 (look for it in the second half of this article). The company will use Nvidiaâs software to train its own proprietary AI algorithms in how to better manage workflows and disrupt bottlenecks. ServiceNow is also well on the path to profitability, which has investors excited about the stockâs near-term and longer-term outlook.

The Polen Global Growth Strategy believes ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) can grow free cash flow at a greater than 20% annualized rate over the next three-to-five years, which it outlined in its Q4 2022 investor letter:

âServiceNow, Inc.Â (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as âworkflowâ) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.

ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.â

7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 131

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 46.8%

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another prominent tech company thatâs rallied in 2023, gaining over 38%. Thatâs great news for investing icon Warren Buffett, whose 13F portfolio has unprecedented exposure to the mobile tech giant at 46.4% as of March 13. Overall, there was a slight drop in hedge fund ownership of Apple during Q1.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares slumped by 27% in 2022 but have quickly made up those losses this year, having pushed back near their all-time highs. While the iPhone still accounts for over 50% of Appleâs revenue, its higher-margin services segment continues to grow at an accelerated rate, hitting $20.9 billion in revenue during the companyâs fiscal Q2 of 2023. That robust services segment also gives Apple an impressively high moat, as it keeps customers insulated within its own ecosystem, which is undoubtedly why Buffett is such a fan of the company.

RiverPark Large Growth Fund believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still one of the most innovative and well-positioned mobile tech companies in the world, as it divulged in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âApple Inc.Â (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were our final top contributor for the quarter. While the company reported a rare quarterly earnings miss, investors had expected slower sales due to macro headwinds. Services continue to be a bright spot for the company with an all-time high of $21 billion in quarterly revenue, a 6% year-over-year increase, and management expects iPhone revenue growth to re-accelerate in 2Q. Operating Cash Flow was $34 billion for the quarter, and the company returned $23 billion to shareholders in the last three months, including $4 billion in dividends and $19 billion in share repurchases.

With an installed base of 2 billion active devices and significant growth of the companyâs recurring revenue Services segment (now 18% of revenue), we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best-positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.â

6. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)

Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72

Year-to-Date Return (through June 5): 49.2%

There was a 25% drop in hedge fund ownership of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) during the final quarter of 2022 as investors worried about weakening demand for the companyâs cybersecurity offerings. There was a slight 9% rebound in hedge fund positions in Q1, during which Crowdstrike posted promising Q4 results and boasted a record Q1 pipeline.

Closing out the first half of our list of hot stocks to buy according to hedge funds is CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), yet another company that has been successfully using AI, in this case to bolster the speed and efficiency of its cybersecurity solutions. CrowdStrikeâs extensible platform has clearly struck a positive note with the majority of its clients, over 60% of which use at least five of the companyâs modules. CrowdStrike isnât overly profitable yet, but it is beginning to generate more free cash flow, a figure which could top $1 billion in the companyâs current fiscal year.

Artisan Developing World Fund discussed CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)âs latest financial results in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âTop contributors to performance for the quarter included graphics semiconductor company Nvidia, Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Sea, Latin American marketplace MercadoLibre, online travel marketplace Airbnb, and endpoint security companyÂ CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.Â (NASDAQ:CRWD). CrowdStrike rebounded as its financial results eased demand-related concerns in its core endpoint business, while adoption in platform adjacencies continued to rise.â

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have performed even better than the aforementioned seven stocks this year, and are also highly regarded by world-class hedge funds. Check out all the details by clicking the link below.

Google Cloud will provide advice and tools for customers to harness AI to identify trends, summarize information, boost automation and generate content, the company said Wednesday. Generative AI powers chatbots such as ChatGPT and image maker Dall-E produce text, images or video by responding to prompts from users.

In recent months, companies have expressed a lot of excitement about generative AIâs potential, but âthereâs always this dynamic of how do you get started,â said Carrie Tharp, Google Cloudâs vice president of industries.

Alphabet Inc.âs Google is trying to use its prowess in AI to set itself apart in the cloud computing market, which is viewed as one of the companyâs best bets for growth as its core search business matures. Google trails Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in the market, but the unit reported its first profitable quarter earlier this year. This week, Google Cloud shared new clients using its generative AI products, including online travel site Priceline and the Mayo Clinic.

Generative AI may produce $1.3 trillion in sales of hardware, software, services and other tools by 2032, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts wrote in a report earlier this month.

Google Cloud also launched more partnerships to deepen its offerings in generative AI, including a deal with startup Typeface, which helps companies use the technology. Typeface has incorporated Googleâs AI models into its offerings, and Google, in turn, is including Typeface in Google Workspace. The companies didnât release financial details of the partnership.

âThe magic happens when you connect all the dots,â said Typeface Chief Executive Officer Abhay Parasnis.

Accurately measuring the climate impact of individual flights has been a thorny issue because the science is inexact. For example, Google Flights last year controversially dropped the inclusion of contrails,Â the streaking ice clouds that trap heat as they trail aircraft in the sky. They donât contain CO2, but are believed to have a large effect on a flightâs contribution to global warming.

Critics have argued that Googleâs current display of flight emissions greatly underestimate their environmental impact because they exclude contrails. Google has countered that it will include them when it can more accurately measure them.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Google announced Wednesday that they are partnering to develop a reliable framework for measuring the emissionsâ impact of flights flown by different airlines, and a way to present these calculations so flyers can make environmentally conscious choices.

As part of this pilot program, the Lufthansa Group agreed to provide data to be used for assessment in these emissions calculations.

âWorking partnerships such as this are essential if we are to move forward quickly to a better understanding of how to assess emissions and to provide greater transparency on the environmental impact of aviation for the general public,â said Luc Tytgat, EASA Strategy and Safety Management Director, in a statement. âSuch data is only meaningful if it is credible and compiled by an independent authority, such as EASA. We believe this can make an important contribution to informing the traveling public as to which flights may be considered to be greener.â

The partnership will help Google and partners develop its Travel Impact Model, a framework for measuring flight emissions per passenger thatâs publicly accessible.

The Travalyst coalition, which includes Amadeus, Booking.com, Expedia Group, Google, Skyscanner, Travelport, Trip.com Group, Tripadvisor and Visa, has been developing that Travel Impact Model. Skyscanner and Google Flights, for example, currently use it to depict the environmental impact of individual flights so consumers can make a green choice â or not.

Google said Travel Impact Model stakeholders, including environmental groups, academics, aviation experts and nonprofits, will help determine methodologies for determining the impact of contrails. In a twist, the Travel Impact Model will transition to a shared governance dynamic, Google said.

Previously, Google drove decisions about the Travel Impact Model. Under the new governance lineup, the stakeholders will share decision-making while Google sees itself as the technology steward.

The S&P 500 was down 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%, or 108 points lower, the Nasdaq fell 1%.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)fell 3% leading a slide in big tech as investors appeared to take some profit on the sector following gains of more than 30% year to date for the tech sector.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was also a big drag even as reports suggested the e-commerce is planning to launch ad-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming platform.

Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) and Paramount (NASDAQ:PARA) climbed 6% and 4% respectively, however, as both firms are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazonâs Prime Video channels.

Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) was also higher on Amazon-related news after announcing that its Adaptive Checkout, would be made available to merchants using Amazon Pay, allowing their customers personalized payment options.

Energy stocks, meanwhile, continued to add to recent gains as oil prices remain supported by Saudi Arabiaâs recent decision to cut production and data showing weekly U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly dropped.

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) were among the biggest gainers rising more than 4%.

On the earnings front, Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates, but the consumer staples company reaffirmed its guidance that fell short of estimates, sending tis shares more than 8%.

Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) rallied 30% after reporting narrower than expected third-quarter losses as cost-cuts helped improve performance.

Some on Wall Street, however, flagged worries about ongoing client losses after the personalized styling service company reported a 20% fall in revenue in the quarter.

âWhile the company has aggressively adjusted the cost structure in light of the current challenges in the business, the big declines on the top line remain a tough pill to swallow,â Wedbush said in a note.

In crypto-related stocks, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) rose nearly 3% after Ark Investâs Cathie Wood bought weakness seen a day earlier, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the cryptocurrency platform accusing it of operating as an unregistered exchange.

The wobble in the broader market comes just a week ahead of the Federal Reserve's June 13-14 meeting, when the central bank is widely expected to keep rates unchanged.

766,2023-05-02T17:56:20+00:00,Thinking Of Buying Boston Properties? Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Add To Your Portfolio,"When investors consider the purchase of a real estate investment trust (REIT), along with performance and dividends, they need to consider the properties and tenants that accompany that REIT. Several questions must be answered: Are the tenants long-term and stable? Are they strong enough to survive recessions and market downturns? Is the portfolio diversified by location, type and annualized base rent (ABR)?

Take a look at one of the largest office REITs today to see whether it answers the above questions affirmatively.

Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) is a Boston-based office REIT with 54.5 million square feet in 192 properties concentrated among six of the largest U.S. cities â Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The firm calls itself âthe largest publicly traded developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.â Boston Properties has had a 555% total return since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997. Itâs a member of the S&P 500.

As of March 31, Boston Properties had 91% of its in-service properties leased, with a weighted average lease term (WALT) of 7.6 years. It presently has 4 million square feet valued at $3.3 billion in its active pipeline property development and another 17.6 million square feet in its future development pipeline.

The Boston area has the largest amount of square footage, but the vacancy rate, as shown in the chart below, is a bit high at 9.03%, and there is another 787,192 square feet that expires before the end of the year.

One potential remedy that Boston Properties has begun to use is the expansion of offices to life science companies, such as Biogen Inc. and AstraZeneca. Boston Properties has a six-story, 271,000-square-foot building in Boston that is 100% leased to Biogen and a 566,000-square-foot building that is 100% preleased to AstraZeneca, with an estimated initial occupancy starting in mid-2026.

Largest tenants

The following chart shows the top 20 tenants presently leasing space from Boston Properties:

Itâs clear from the list that Boston Properties has a well-diversified top 20 client list, with many of its tenants publicly traded. Its top four tenants, Salesforce Inc. (NYSE: CRM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Akamai Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM) account for about 11% of the total ABR.

As for industry diversification, technology and media companies are the largest group, with 21% of rent, followed by legal services at 19% and financial services at 17%. While only three groups account for 57%, the remaining 43% is divided among eight other industry classifications.

Some of its largest tenants are well-known market leaders.

Salesforce Inc. is a San Francisco-based software company that provides sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics and application development. Salesforce was founded by Marc Benioff, a former executive at Oracle Corp. Its IPO was in 2004. It was the first cloud computing company to reach $1 billion in annual revenue in 2009. As of September 2022, it was the 61st largest company in the world by market capitalization and has a present market capitalization of $206.63 billion. Salesforce contributes 3.43% of Boston Propertiesâ ABR.

Alphabet is the third-largest technology company by annual revenue in the world, and one of the FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) stocks that comprise the Nasdaq 100. The original founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, were replaced by Sundar Pichai near the end of 2019. It has a market capitalization of $1.62 trillion.

Biogen Inc. is a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based multinational biotechnology company. It specializes in the discovery and delivery of therapies to treat a range of neurological diseases. Biogen was founded in 1978 in Geneva by a group of prominent biologists. At the time it was called Biotechnology Geneva. In 2003, Biogen merged with IDEC Pharmaceuticals in San Diego, and the name was changed to Biogen Idec. With this merger, Biogen became the third-largest biotechnology company in the world.

Over the decades, Biogen has grown by acquiring several other pharmaceutical companies that have developed notable treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, hemophilia, spinal muscular atrophy and other diseases. In 2020, Biogen constructed a state-of-the-art facility in Switzerland to produce a new drug called aducanumab, which will be used to treat Alzheimerâs disease.

Biogen contributes 2.61% of the total ABR.

Other Factors

Boston Properties has $15.7 billion in debt, of which 77.58% is unsecured and 22.42% is secured. It has $3.2 billion in liquidity, which includes $1.7 billion in cash and a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.

Boston Properties pays a quarterly dividend of $0.98 per share. The dividend has not been increased since December 2019, but to its credit, Boston Properties never cut or suspended its dividend during the pandemic. The $3.92 annual dividend yields 7.8%, which is more than double its five-year dividend yield average of 3.85%. With the forward funds from operations (FFO) of $7.16, the payout ratio is a safe 54%.

Despite the lack of dividend growth, the yield has expanded because of a substantial loss of share price from obstacles such as COVID-19, an increasing home-based workforce, inflation, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and ongoing fears of recession.

Having survived threats to share price from COVID-19, Boston Properties rallied from $63 in 2020 to $125 by March 2022. But with the interest rate hikes and concerns about increasing vacancies, office REITs have tumbled again since then. Boston Properties fell to $48.50 by the end of March. Since then, itâs rebounded, but only by about 8%.

It also doesnât help the office REIT sub-sector when Wall Street gurus like Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway and more recently Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk are predicting the demise of commercial office buildings by the end of 2023. Ironically, the same Musk, along with the late billionaire real estate developer Sam Zell, recently chastised home-based workers, saying they were less productive and that itâs hypocritical to ask first responders and others to work on-site while they have the luxury of working from home.

Recent Events

On April 25, Boston Properties announced its first-quarter 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.73 was lower than FFO of $1.82 in the first quarter of 2022, but revenue of $803.2 million was up from $754.31 million year over year. Boston Properties also said that second-quarter FFO would come in at a range from $1.79 to $1.81 and that full-year 2023 FFO would be $7.14-$7.20.

On May 17, Boston Properties announced it was filing for a mixed shelf of debt securities, guarantees, common stock, preferred stock, stock purchase contracts, depository shares and warrants, but the size of the offering was not disclosed.

There was one recent insider purchase, and thatâs a positive sign. On May 31, Director Carol Einiger purchased 10,000 shares at an average price of $47.41 for an approximate total of $474,100.

On June 6, Boston Properties participated in the 2023 NAREIT REITweek Investor Conference.

There have been no recent analyst upgrades or downgrades on Boston Properties. The most recent analyst rating was on May 10 when Citigroup analyst Emmanuel Korchman maintained Boston Properties with a Neutral rating but lowered the price target 25% from $72 to $54.

Short interest on Boston Properties is 5.52%. When compared to rival office REITs such as SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG), whose short interest is 27.06%, that doesnât seem so bad. But itâs still another headwind for Boston Properties.

In summary, Boston Properties is a well-diversified office REIT, with the kind of Grade A long-term tenants that are unlikely to have problems paying rent. But the dark cloud hanging over the heads of office REITs in 2023 continues to prevail.

It is unlikely that office REITs will sit passively by and allow vacancies to pile up. Office space can always be converted into other types of facilities. Mixed-use space that incorporates offices, apartments, restaurants, nightclubs and health facilities is one of the most recent trends among REITs. Long-term investors have a real opportunity to pick up shares of Boston Properties now with a terrific dividend yield and the potential for outstanding total returns over several years.

Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%. Check out Benzingaâs Real Estate Offering Screener to discover the latest passive real estate investments.

767,2023-05-02T17:26:52+00:00,Stock market winners in 2023 are last year's losers,"When it comes to market sectors, last yearâs losers are this yearâs winners.

The S&P 500âs best performers are Technology (XLK), Communication Services (XLC), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), up about 32%, 32% and 22%, respectively, so far this year. Itâs worth noting those three sectors were the worst performers of 2022 as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates and investors worried about a looming recession.

Investors who stuck with last year's laggards, have seen their luck change in 2023.

Even the badly beaten Homebuilders ETF (XHB) is up 24% year-to-date. The exchange traded fund which includes names like Lennar (LEN) and Toll Brothers (TOL) was down almost 29% in 2022 amid rising mortgage rates.

In contrast, energy stocks, the superstars of 2022, have lost their luster this year. Energy Select (XLE), is down more than 6% YTD. Keep in mind, the sector gained a whopping 64% in 2022.

""Energy is negatively correlated with tech as investors tend to use energy stocks as a source of funds to invest in tech,"" Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance.

That trend has also been accentuated amid demand concerns for oil given China's weaker-than-expected recovery once Covid lockdowns were lifted.

Much of the tech-fueled rally this year comes amid an expectation of a Fed rate pause by mid-year, low unemployment and a frenzy over generative artificial intelligence.

The banking crisis in March caused a steep sell-off in financials and other cyclical stocks as investors moved towards technology names.

""Large cap tech stocks were perceived as a safe haven during the banking crisis as most tech stocks have low debt or even net cash positions. Then the AI boom started as Chat GPT was released, fueling further rotation into tech stocks,"" Hatfield said.

The trend accelerated as chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) posted a better-than-expected quarter and blockbuster guidance. The stock, which was down 48% last year, has come roaring back 162% since the start of 2023.

Overall, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up roughly 25% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has gained 11%. Yet strategists point to the lack of breadth of 2023's rally as flashing a warning sign.

âWe may be on the cusp of a new bull market here, but I think this bull market really deserves an asterisk until we see some broader participation. And right now, we're just not seeing it,"" Adam Phillips, Managing Director of Portfolio Strategy at EP Wealth Advisors recently told Yahoo Finance Live.

Investors piling money into the AI trade has been feeding the concentration of market gains among a handful of companies.

Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett calls these out-performers, the 'Magnificent Seven' â Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA).

The 'Magnificent Seven' account for 83% of the Nasdaq 100's $4 trillion growth in market valuation in 2023. Apple and Microsoft have each gained more in value than the entire bottom 93 stocks, Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre recently noted. Nvidia stock, which was down 48% last year, has come roaring back 162% since the start of 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

âWhen you're counting on just a few stocks to drive performance, that, historically, has not ended well,"" Jim Tierney, AB chief investment officer of Concentrated US Growth, told Yahoo Finance Live.

âThe market has to broaden out, or at some point, these 8 or 10 stocks just loseâ run out of gas.â

769,2023-05-02T16:45:04+00:00,"Google, Meta using 'bullying tactics' against Canada's news bill, says PM Trudeau","By Ismail Shakil

OTTAWA, June 7 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms are using ""bullying tactics"" against a Canadian push aimed at ensuring financial support for news publishers, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday.

The proposed legislation is designed to compel internet giants like Google and Meta's Facebook to negotiate commercial deals and pay publishers for their content.

The U.S. firms say proposals in the bill, dubbed the ""Online News Act,"" are unsustainable for their businesses.

Google and Facebook have run tests this year to limit some users from viewing or sharing news content in Canada as a potential response if the legislation is passed into law in its current form.

""The fact that these internet giants would rather cut off Canadians' access to local news than pay their fair share is a real problem, and now they're resorting to bullying tactics to try and get their way - it's not going to work,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.

The legislation passed Canada's House of Commons in December and is in the unelected upper chamber of the parliament, which rarely blocks legislation cleared by the lower house.

Canada's media industry wants tighter regulation of tech companies to prevent them from elbowing news businesses out of the online advertising market.

The bill, introduced in April 2022, is similar to a ground-breaking law passed in Australia in 2021.

""The various internet giants like Meta are posting every year record profits while at the same time local independent news is struggling across this country,"" Trudeau said. ""We will continue to make sure that these incredibly profitable corporations contribute to strengthening our democracy.""

Google says the proposed rules are more stringent than those enacted in Australia and Europe. Spokesperson Shay Purdy, reacting to Trudeau's remarks, said the bill ""has some serious problems that make it unworkable for our products and services"".

In a city where emergencies rarely affect the steady flow of commerce, the metropolis came to a near standstill in the face of what local officials called an âunprecedented event.â

Heavy smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted South, creating an apocalyptic orange fog enveloping much of the state and neighboring regions, as far south as Mexico.

âThis is not the day to train for a marathon or to do an outside event for your children,â Adams said at a press conference Wednesday, urging people to remain indoors or don N95 masks.

The smoke briefly halted inbound flights to LaGuardia Airport as visibility diminished and some of the regionâs ports have now been shut. Outdoor activities at city schools were canceled and the Health Department ordered a work suspension for the cityâs carriage horses. Children at some schools in the region were sent home masked.

Baseball fans were left disappointed after the New York Yankees game against the Chicago White Sox Wednesday night was postponed with the strange fog hovering over the Bronx, while an outdoor food tasting event featuring 40 restaurants hosted by the Central Park Conservancy was halted.

These sort of apocalyptic scenes have played out frequently on the West Coast, where wildfires blanketed much of Northern California in smoke in recent years and turned San Franciscoâs skies orange in 2020.

Listen to The Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify.

But itâs stunning New Yorkers who have enjoyed improving air quality over the past decade.

The wildfire smoke is filling the air with dangerous levels of fine particulate matter and according to state officials created the worst air conditions in New York state in more than 20 years, since another Canadian wildfire smoke enveloped the state.

Conditions are forecast to temporarily improve later tonight and tomorrow morning, before they deteriorate again, Adams said in his press conference.

By one measure, air quality in New York is currently the worst of any major city in the world, according to IQAir, a pollution mapping tool. Adams urged New Yorkers to keep their windows closed, and turn off settings on their air conditioners that circulate air from outside.

Airborne particles and toxins can cause complications for patients with lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cardiovascular illness, and can be more serious for young children and older people.

New Yorkers blanketed social media Wednesday afternoon with pictures of the city as few could recall seeing it before â with its landmark buildings and bridges rapidly becoming invisible beneath the curtain of thick smog. Shortly after noon, the Statue of Liberty, typically visible on a clear summer day in June, looked like a dark smudge on the horizon when viewed from the Hudson River shoreline in lower Manhattan.

By Wednesday afternoon, the stateâs Department of Environmental Conservation had issued a health advisory for every region in the entire state, except the Adirondacks, warning the air quality will reach âunhealthyâ levels that could remain through all of Thursday.

Governor Kathy Hochul urged school districts statewide to cancel any outdoor events or sports practices if they hadnât already.

âPeople need to prepare for this as a long haul,â Hochul said Wednesday.

âYesterday New Yorkers saw and smelled something that has never impacted us on this scale before,â Adams said. âAs I was out walking the streets clearly we knew something was happening that was beyond normal.â

Google is the latest company to tighten its return-to-work policies to get workers to commute more often. In an internal email, the company said it could make office attendance an element of an employee's performance review if they did not comply with the three-day minimum for in-office work, reports the Wall Street Journal.

Nor is Google planing to grow the number of its employees working-from-home full-time. The company said it will only consider allowing fully remote arrangements in exceptional cases.

""Our employees have been in our hybrid work model for over a year nowâspending three days a week in the office and the other two working from home,â Google spokesperson Ryan Lamont told Fortune in an email. âItâs going well, and we want to see Googlers connecting and collaborating in-person, so weâre limiting remote work to exception only.â

Google first started asking employees to spend three days a week in the office over a year ago. The move, which came after two years of remote work due to pandemic-related restrictions, was a logistical mess at first due to a deluge of returning employees.

""Our hybrid approach is designed to incorporate the best of being together in person with the benefits of working from home for part of the week. Now that we're more than a year into this way of working, weâre formally integrating this approach into all of our workplace policies,â Lamont said.

Google did not return Fortune's request for further elaboration on how attendance will be linked to employee performance.

RTO mandate struggle

Tech companies have struggled to get their workers to comply with return-to-office mandates, and firms like Google are now clamping down on remote work to get people back.

Some companies are turning to creative ways to get workers back in the office. Cloud company Salesforceoffered to donate $10 to a local charity for each day of in-person work from an employee between June 12 and June 23, Fortune reported Tuesday.

Google's employees won't have as nice an office experience as they would have had before the pandemic. The search giant, in a bid to cut costs, did away with employee perks like free massages and said it expected workers to share desks.

A long-due end to remote work?

Working-from-home became the preferred way of working for many during the pandemicâbut the time of fully remote work may be coming to an end. The drive to get workers to come in to the office at least part of the time accelerated this year, with companies like Disney, Meta, and Starbucks announcing plans for at least a few days of in-person work a week.

Employees have criticized these policies. Amazon called its workers back into the office with effect in May, spurring protests. Employees staged a walk-out over the return-to-work policy last week, but the tech and cloud giant has remained unfazed so far.

Yet despite these corporate efforts, office occupancy in the top 10 metro cities is still averaging less than 50% each week, according to security firm Kastle Systems, reflecting the choice of employees to maintain flexibility between remote and in-person work.

Remote workâs impact on productivity

Google argues that it needs in-person work to encourage collaboration. ""Not everyone believes in âmagical hallway conversations,â but thereâs no question that working together in the same room makes a positive difference,"" wrote Google chief people officer Fiona Cicconi in the email announcing the change, reports the Wall Street Journal.

Google is not the only tech company that believes that workers are helped by opportunities for in-person work and collaboration.

Both Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg claim that fully remote workers are less productive than those who had at least some in-person office time before the pandemic. âOur early analysis of performance data suggests that engineers who either joined Meta in-person and then transferred to remote or remained in-person performed better on average than people who joined remotely,â Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a statement in March.

It is still unclear how remote work changes employee productivity. Managers believe that staying at home hurts performance, while employees argue the opposite. Workers also save time by not commuting, which is often put towards doing more work. And as much as companies want workers back, experts argue that remote work will be part of the new normal.

June 8 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google and Microsoft are inserting ads into AI experiments without providing an option to opt out of participation, an approach that has already rankled some brands and risks further pushback from the industry, ad buyers told Reuters.

The two tech giants are racing to revamp their search engines with artificial intelligence that can produce written responses to open-ended queries. That process will upend how advertisers reach consumers through ads on search results, a market that is estimated to grow 10% to $286 billion this year, according to research firm MAGNA.

Microsoft is testing ads in the Bing AI chatbot, which began rolling out to users in February, by relocating some traditional search ads and inserting them into the AI responses, the company said.

In a May interview, Googleâs general manager of ads, Jerry Dischler, said the tech company would also use existing search ads to experiment with ad placements within the AI search snapshots, an early-test feature called Search Generative Experience that first became available last month.

Both companies said they are in the early stages of testing ads in generative AI features and were actively working with advertisers and soliciting their feedback.

Some advertisers are wary of their marketing budgets being spent on features that are available to a limited number of users, ad buyers said. Advertisers typically also want to have control over where their ads appear online and are cautious about appearing next to inappropriate or unsuitable content.

Microsoft and Google said existing guard rails on their search engines, including lists of blocked keywords to prevent ads from appearing on those queries, would also apply to their AI search features.

The two companies have poured billions into generative AI, making it crucial to derive revenue from the technology.

'BLACK BOX'

Testing new ad placements without gaining consent from brands is a concerning practice for advertisers, said Jason Lee, executive vice president of brand safety at Horizon Media, a media agency that has worked with brands like insurer GEICO and Corona beer. Another ad buyer at a major ad agency also said the practice was not considered standard in the industry.

Multiple large advertisers temporarily pulled their ad spending from Microsoft in response, according to an ad buyer familiar with the matter. Among them, Wells Fargo continues to keep some of its ad budget off Microsoft, the person added.

Wells Fargo did not respond to a request for comment.

In an interview, Lynne Kjolso, Microsoftâs vice president of global partner and retail media, said the company aimed to make the introduction of the new Bing ad formats as âseamlessâ as possible for advertisers, without creating more work for them.

Microsoft recently launched hotel ads in the Bing chatbot and is working to introduce ads for other industries, such as real estate, she said.

The concerns from advertisers also play in to a larger tension as tech platforms increasingly offer AI solutions that could produce better results for advertisers but require them to give up some level of control over their ads.

âThis is not the first time that Google and Bing have expanded their networks while restricting control for advertisers,â said Samantha Aiken, a paid search supervisor at marketing agency Code3.

For example, many in the industry consider Googleâs Performance Max, a tool that uses AI to automatically find the best ad placements across multiple Google products instead of requiring advertisers to set up different ad campaigns, to be an analytical âblack box,â she said, as the algorithmic models do not disclose how it determines where to serve ads.

Three ad buyers said they were concerned about Microsoftâs lack of transparency reporting, or reports that can show what search terms triggered a brandâs ads to appear in generative AI experiences, or how the ads performed versus traditional search ads.

While Microsoft representatives have been receptive to the concerns, they have not provided a timeline for when more transparency reporting would be available, two of the ad buyers said.

âAdvertisers canât just go in and pull the report to see how often they're showing (in the Bing chatbot),â said one of the ad buyers, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with a business partner.

Kjolso said transparency reports have been a top request from ad agencies, and that Microsoftâs product teams were âworking on it with priority.â

âWe are absolutely thinking through what additional levers and controls we need to be able to provide to advertisers,â she said, adding that sales teams were actively working with some brands to allay any concerns about where their ads are appearing.

Two media buyers from major ad agencies said there were questions about how the search giants would prevent ads from appearing on AI responses that include ""hallucinations"" or false information.

Bingâs Web information can act as a ""grounding"" mechanism for large-language models and actually reduce the risk of hallucinations, Kjolso said.

(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google and Microsoft are inserting ads into AI experiments without providing an option to opt out of participation, an approach that has already rankled some brands and risks further pushback from the industry, ad buyers told Reuters.

The two tech giants are racing to revamp their search engines with artificial intelligence that can produce written responses to open-ended queries. That process will upend how advertisers reach consumers through ads on search results, a market that is estimated to grow 10% to $286 billion this year, according to research firm MAGNA.

Microsoft is testing ads in the Bing AI chatbot, which began rolling out to users in February, by relocating some traditional search ads and inserting them into the AI responses, the company said.

In a May interview, Googleâs general manager of ads, Jerry Dischler, said the tech company would also use existing search ads to experiment with ad placements within the AI search snapshots, an early-test feature called Search Generative Experience that first became available last month. Google said advertisers are currently not able to opt out of the test.

Alphabet's estimated fair value is US$160 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$123 suggests Alphabet is potentially 24% undervalued Analyst price target for GOOGL is US$132 which is 18% below our fair value estimate

Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.

Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.

View our latest analysis for Alphabet

The Model

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$69.8b US$85.1b US$99.5b US$114.6b US$130.2b US$141.7b US$151.4b US$159.6b US$166.7b US$172.9b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x14 Analyst x14 Analyst x9 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 8.86% Est @ 6.83% Est @ 5.42% Est @ 4.43% Est @ 3.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4%  US$64.3k US$72.3k US$78.0k US$82.8k US$86.8k US$87.1k US$85.8k US$83.4k US$80.3k US$76.8k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)
Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$798b

We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$173bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (8.4%â 2.1%) = US$2.8t

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8tÃ· ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$1.2t

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.0t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$123, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf

Important Assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.067. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Alphabet

Strength

Debt is not viewed as a risk.

Weakness

Earnings declined over the past year.

Opportunity

Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.

Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.

Moving On:

Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Alphabet, there are three additional factors you should consider:

785,2023-05-02T11:00:00+00:00,Google Contract Staff That Helped Train AI Seek To Unionize,"(Bloomberg) -- A group of Alphabet Inc. contract workers are launching a unionization campaign, saying they need a greater voice at the company that has tasked them with work on its most high-profile products, including training generative AI answers in Googleâs search engine and chatbot.

The workers, who are employed via the vendor Accenture Plc, are seeking to negotiate directly with Alphabet, which they argue is legally also their boss.

The group is organizing with the Alphabet Workers Union, and said it has signed up the vast majority of its proposed bargaining unit, which includes about 120 writers, graphic designers and launch coordinators who create internal and external Google content, including all of the materials for Google Help support pages. Theyâve also recently helped to review AI-generated content.

The workers said they hope to bargain for changes including increased paid time off, control over accepting assignments outside the scope of their usual work and competitive pay that reflects their skill sets. The employees are asking management to voluntarily recognize and negotiate with the union. The workers contend Alphabet is a âjoint employerâ â a company with enough control over a group of employees to be liable for their treatment and obligated to negotiate if they unionize, even if it doesnât sign their paychecks.

âWeâve spent two years organizing and are trying to get a fair shake,â said Laura Greene, a multimedia team leader with Accenture. âBasically, we decided that the only way to get real, lasting change is to formally unionize and, ideally, negotiate at the bargaining table.âAlphabet didnât immediately respond to a request for comment. Accenture acknowledged that it received a letter from workers requesting that the company recognize its union. âWe always value the ability to listen directly to our people and respond to their concerns,â Rachel Frey, an Accenture spokesperson, said in a statement.

In a letter sent to management Wednesday afternoon, workers said that over the four-year life of their contract, they had consistently requested that Google and Accenture consider their expertise and experience in executing their work, but were routinely disregarded. âInstead of recognizing us as highly specialized workers worthy of respect, we are treated as resources for Google to exhaust, despite our expertise and how much genuine care we put into this complex work,â they wrote.

In January, the workers said, they were recruited for a top secret project â working on the companyâs then-unannounced chatbot, Bard. They were told to answer theoretical prompts and fact-check Bardâs responses, a job that required research and creativity. For a brief period on the Bard project, Accenture workers were also asked to handle obscene, graphic and offensive prompts, they said. Though the workers were told they could skip certain tasks, they also risked getting penalized in other ways for passing on the work.

At least one person filed a complaint with human resources at Accenture. In February, the work they had been doing was transferred over to their Accenture counterparts based in Manila, the workers said. The change raised concerns among the US staffers that the work they are assigned could be taken away at any point and offloaded to cheaper labor elsewhere.

The Accenture labor struggle is one of several partially motivated by AI concerns. TV and film writers have been on strike for a month, demanding protections including restrictions on the use of computer-generated manuscripts; some picket lines have featured the chant âAI? Bye-Bye.â In May, journalists at CNET announced a unionization campaign, saying they wanted a voice in workplace decision-making âespecially as automated technology threatens our jobs and reputations.â

The outcome of the Google workersâ organizing effort may not be immediately clear. When a majority of employees at a work site sign up to unionize in the US, a company can voluntarily recognize and negotiate with the labor group or refuse to do so unless the union first prevails in a government-run election. The process of determining who should be eligible to vote in an election can take weeks or months, and companies often use that time to fight organizing efforts by using tactics such as mandatory anti-union meetings.

And even after securing union recognition, progress can be slow. YouTube Music workers hired via the staffing agency Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. voted to unionize in April, but Alphabet is appealing a US National Labor Relations Board officialâs decision deeming it a joint employer of the workers. The legal battle could drag on for years, as could also end up happening with the Accenture staff.

The Accenture workers said theyâre undeterred by the prospect of a long campaign. âWhat we really want is longevity in the job, and more respect and autonomy from Google,â said Tahlia Kirk, a writer and team trainer with Accenture.

Advertising has been an area of continued growth for Amazon, growing by 21% year over year to $9.5 billion in the first quarter, the Wall Street JournalÂ reports.

It is the third-biggest player in terms of digital ad revenue in the U.S. afterÂ Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), according to Insider Intelligence.

Advertisers expressed interest in Amazon offeringÂ an ad tier for Prime Video service, likely to inspire other streaming platforms, including Netflix, Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS). Specifically, ad buyers claimed more access to premium movies and programs that have mainly remained ad-free.

Amazon has been attempting to bring more ad-supported programming to Prime Video.

Separately, Amazon is discussing withÂ Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (NASDAQ: WBD) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) about adding the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Prime Video Channels.

Through Prime Video Channels, users can subscribe to streaming services, including the ad-free versions of Max and Paramount+, and view through the app.

Amazon is weighing multiple ways of introducing ads in Prime Video, including bringing more advertising to existing Prime subscribers with an option to pay more for an ad-free alternative and other features. It is planning for shorter ad breaks.

Creating an ad tier would help Amazon cover the costs of producing its shows and movies, considering CEO Andy Jassy's growing focus on profitability.

Internally CEO Andy Jassy had expressed his faith in the value of entertainment, mainly live sports.

Meanwhile, Amazon is discussing bidding for the rights to stream National Basketball Association games and adding that launching a Prime Video ad-supported tier could help pay for those rights.

Price Action: AMZN shares closed lower by 4.25% at $121.23 on Wednesday.

Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.

Alphabet Inc. currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.22, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 34 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.22 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the 34 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 28 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.4% and 11.8% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying Alphabet Inc., but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR

Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.

Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Should You Invest in GOOG?

In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet Inc., the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.41.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet Inc. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet Inc.

791,2023-05-01T22:01:00+00:00,Why Alphabet Rose 14.5% in May,"Shares of search and cloud giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) rose 14.5% in May, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Google parent unveiled many new technologies during its I/O conference early in the month. Alphabet had been a relative laggard during the first quarter compared with some of its big-tech brethren, as investors feared that generative AI could disrupt the conglomerate's core search business."
792,2023-05-01T20:44:48+00:00,The AI boom hasn't moved the needle on the VC funding landscape yet,"AI investments may be hot, but the VC space overall remains noticeably cool, recent Crunchbase data shows.

VC funding globally shook out to nearly $22 billion in May 2023, the data reveals. While that marks a slight uptick month-over-month, it's still a jarring year-over-over decline of 44%. This funding drop comes despite a surge of investments in AI-focused companies.

The AI hype is high, to be sure, and it traces back to the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which gained widespread public recognition in late 2022. In the public markets, companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and C3AI (AI) have seen their shares skyrocket, and, in Nvidia's case, it's been a monumental shift â the chipmaker is now careening towards and around a trillion-dollar market cap.

The AI hype has, predictably, translated to funding on a VC level â to an extent. There's good news, to be sure. For example, Toronto-based Cohere, which competes with ChatGPT, reportedly raised $250 million in May in a deal that values that company at $2 billion. Likewise, also in May, generative AI video platform Runway reportedly raised about $100 million in funding, valuing the company at $1.5 billion.

Likewise, big-name AI startups like Google-backed (GOOG, GOOGL) Anthropic, and AI-focused cloud startup CoreWeave raised rounds, coming in at rounds of $450 million and $421 million respectively.

However, for all the AI hype, these types of investments only accounted for 13% of total VC funding in May. BRAZIL - 2023/04/03: In this photo illustration, the Cohere logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

Nevertheless, there still are a few other pockets of optimism. In May, Crunchbase data shows that there were 10 newly-minted unicorns â a term for private startups valued at $1 billion or more â two of which were Cohere and Runway. Though that number is down from 34 this time last year, May's 10 new unicorns are double the number we saw in April and mark the first time since November that the new unicorn count hit the low double-digits.

However, the overall picture is one that still reads gloomy and shows that across the board, investors remain cautious â that 44% year-over-year decline is tough to shake off and a quiet VC landscape isn't new. VC investments have been down for seed, early, and late-stage startups for some time, and so far, that remains the case. The reality is this: AI is hot, but the economy isn't and, for all the excitement surrounding AI, it remains a minor part of the overall economic picture.

Microsoft is testing ads in the Bing AI chatbot by migrating some traditional search ads and inserting them into the AI responses, ReutersÂ reports.

Both companies are in the early stages of testingÂ ads in generative AI features in their race to revamp their search engines with AI capable of written responses to open-ended queries.

Some advertisers were concerned about marketing budgets spent on features available to a limited number of users. Advertisers also want control over where their ads appear online.

Microsoft and Google said existing guard rails on their search engines would also apply to their AI search features.

The two companies have splurged billions into generative AI with Microsoft's multibillion-dollar bet on ChatGPT parent OpenAI and Google's $400 million stake in Anthropic.

However, multiple large advertisers, includingÂ Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC), temporarily pulled their ad spending from Microsoft.

Microsoft recently launched hotel ads in the Bing chatbot and is working to introduce ads for other industries, like real estate.

Three ad buyers expressed concerns over Microsoft's lack of transparency in reporting.

Two media buyers from significant ad agencies flagged how the search firms would prevent ads from appearing on AI responses with false information, according to Reuters.

Price Actions: MSFT shares traded lower by 0.19% at $322.78 premarket on the last check Thursday. GOOG shares traded lower by 0.02% at $122.91.

795,2023-05-01T17:00:12+00:00,Google Cloud says it will reimburse customers up to $1 million if theyâre victims of a crypto-mining scam,"The cloud computing arm of Google announced on Thursday that it will reimburse customers for up to $1 million in costs from the unauthorized use of their accounts for crypto mining.

Those who enroll in the cloud providerâs premium tier of Security Command Center, or Google Cloudâs layer of security features, will be eligible for the added protection, Google said in a blog post announcing the new policy.

âWe have enough cryptocurrency mining detection capabilities built into Security Command Center now that we feel confident in our ability to prevent crypto mining from happening,â Jess Leroy, a senior director of product management at Google Cloud, told Fortune. âWe thought that this was a great way to put our money where our mouth is.â

Crypto-mining attacks can occur after hackers gain access to a userâs cloud account. Once theyâre in, they rapidly accelerate how much computing power the account holders use in order to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero. As the computing power consumed increases, so do the costs cloud providers unknowingly bill victims.

In fact, nearly two-thirds of all hacked cloud accounts were used to mine crypto in the second quarter of 2022, Google said in a research report published in September.

âCrypto-mining attacks continue to be a serious security and financial issue for organizations who do not have the right preventative controls and threat detection capabilities in their cloud environments,â Philip Bues, a researcher at International Data Corporation who follows cloud security trends, said in a statement.

The financial protections Google Cloud has introduced for crypto mining follows a previous commitment to reimburse customers who are victims of DDoS attacks, or when bad actors flood a website with traffic in order to temporarily paralyze it, Google Cloudâs Leroy told Fortune.

The cloud providerâs crypto-mining protections join its suite of Web3 offerings as the third-largest cloud services firm by market share, according to data from Synergy Research Group, looks to adapt its business to rising interest in crypto.

Google Cloud has announced a suite of partnerships with big-name players in Web3, including Nansen, Coinbase, and BNB Chain. Itâs even unveiled a Web3 startup program that provides developers a slew of discounts on crypto products as well as access to millions in funds from foundations that support protocols like Solana, Polygon, and Aptos.

The S&P 500 was up 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5%, or 180 points higher, and the Nasdaq rose 0.9%.

Initial Jobless claims unexpectedly rose 28,000 to 261,000, the largest jump since October 2021, pointing to signs of cooling in the labor market.

âWe remain of the view that the risk of a full-blown layoff cycle later in the Summer remains substantial as businesses will look to cut costs and recapture more margin,â Jefferies said in a note.

Treasury yields fell on the news as bets on the Fed pause edged higher, underpinned by growth sectors of the market including tech and consumer discretionary.

With the expectations of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), big tech racked up gains led by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter announcing it will make its ChatGPT-infused AI models available to U.S. government agency.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) rose 4% after launching an enterprise tier for its AI art tool, Firefly, and said it was working with businesses to explore how the tool could help cut costs and boost efficiencies.

The announcement arrived just a week ahead of Adobeâs second-quarter results due June 15. The software makerâs Q2 results will be parsed for further updates on AI and its planned acquisition of Figma, Deutsche Bank said in a note, after hiking its price target on the stock to $500 from $430.

GameStop (NYSE:GME), meanwhile, slid 17% after the video company reported quarterly results that missed estimates and announced it had fired CEO Matthew Furlong and appointed Ryan Cohen as executive chairman.

The shakeup at the top, however, isnât likely to provide the company with the impetus needed to turn around performance, Wedbush said in a note Thursday.

âWe remain convinced that GameStop is doomed, with declining physical software sales and a shift of sales to subscription services and digital downloads sealing its fate,â Wedbush added after cutting its price target on the stock to $6.20 from $6.30.

Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) jumped 54% after the online car seller upgraded its second-quarter outlook, forecasting adjusted gross profit per unit to top $6,000, compared with a prior forecast of above $5,000.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also drove the broader market higher, a day after hitting its highest level of the year, as the EV maker is reportedly in talks with Spanish government officials about building a $4.8 billion gigafactory in Valencia.

Energy pared some losses as oil prices moved off session lows after the White House denied a Wall Street report suggesting it was close to agreeing an interim nuclear deal with Iran that would allow the latter to resume oil exports.

âOvernight, workersâ professionalism has been disregarded in favor of ambiguous attendance tracking practices tied to our performance evaluations,â Chris Schmidt, a Google software engineer, said Thursday in a statement released by the Alphabet Workers Union, which represents some contract and direct employees at Google.

Alphabet Inc.âs Google sent an email to employees Wednesday saying the company expected most staffers to return to the office regularly.

âNot everyone believes in âmagical hallway conversations,â but thereâs no question that working together in the same room makes a positive difference,â Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi wrote in the email, which was reviewed by Bloomberg. Cicconi said many of the products unveiled in May at Google I/O, the tech companyâs annual developer conference, and at its Google Marketing Live event were âconceived, developed and built by teams working side by side.â

Attendance will now be a factor in employeesâ performance reviews, Cicconi said, and teams will start sending reminders to workers who are consistently absent from the office â barring special circumstances like the air-quality-control warning in Canada and the US East Coast this week. Moving forward, Google will consider new remote requests by exception only, she said.

Google previously planned to bring employees back to the office three days a week in April of last year. In 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company had said that about 20% of employees would be able to work remotely full time.

In January, Alphabet enacted the largest job cuts in its history, slashing more than 6% of its workforce, or about 12,000 staffers. The company has also worked to reduce its real estate footprint after announcing a plan to spend $7 billion on new offices and data centers in 2021. In its first-quarter earnings report in April, Alphabet said it spent $564 million related to office-space reductions.

âOur hybrid approach is designed to incorporate the best of being together in person with the benefits of working from home for part of the week,â Ryan Lamont, a Google spokesperson, said in a statement. âNow that weâre more than a year into this way of working, weâre formally integrating this approach into all of our workplace policies.â

The Alphabet Workers Union says it has 1,400-plus members. Schmidt, the Google software engineer, said that a âone size fits allâ return-to-office policy ignores workersâ life circumstances.

âWe deserve a voice in shaping the policies that impact our lives to establish clear, transparent and fair working conditions for all of us,â Schmidt said.

With that, there's a lot to know about Googleâs latest AI features for Android.

A Taste Of What Google Is Doing With Android And AI

At the 2023 Google I/O event, Google presented a next-generation generative AI wallpaper feature. It allows you to generate a wallpaper using a simple prompt. This is in addition to Cinematic Wallpaper, a feature that transforms your photos into 3D wallpapers with the aid of AI. These unique applications enhance Androidâs customizability, which remains one of its major advantages over Apple's iOS.

Googleâs introduction of Magic Compose to Google Messages marked yet another step forward in the AI arms race. This feature lets you communicate text meanings in varying contexts.

For example, if youâre aiming for a more professional tone, it can rewrite your text to reflect that. This is a game-changer for many people who struggle to convey their thoughts in text message form.

New AI-based features are becoming the status quo for startups and tech giants alike. For example, Snapify is rolling out an all-in-one AI-powered solution to redefine professional photography. The startup has raked in millions from retail investors to make it happen.

Google also highlighted the role of on-device AI, showcasing PaLM 2 and its smallest model, Gecko, which is designed for mobile device use. This emphasis on on-device and hybrid AI is set to facilitate the integration of AI into even more applications within the Android ecosystem.

Googleâs drive to enhance and integrate AI technology, demonstrated at Google I/O 2023, is advancing the Android ecosystem significantly. The companyâs latest features, from generative AI wallpaper to Magic Compose, not only boost Androidâs customizability but also optimizes communication.

On-device AI implementation, showcased with the PaLM 2 model Gecko, sets the stage for broader AI integration into Android apps, signaling a transformative era for mobile technology.

Nearly 64% of his hedge fund portfolio is comprised of tech stocks, followed by consumer goods at slightly over 13.5%. Talking at the Forbes and Shook Research Top Advisors Summit in Las Vegas in February 2018, the billionaire said:

âI truly believe that in every portfolio you need to ask yourself what is going to be more relevant 5 to 10 years versus today[...]The most interesting trend is that technology, which used to be mostly software and semiconductors and obscure things, itâs coming everywhere, itâs the future of cars and the future of transportation and every sector.â

(NASDAQ:META) is up over 100% year to date and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stocks have also fared well and are up 31.00% and 35.61% YTD, respectively. In an investor note, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said:

""While the tech skeptics will continue to lay their cards on valuations, Fed narrative, next shoe to drop thesis (debt ceiling the latest fear), and fire in a crowded theater rinse and repeat thinking: we believe overall the set-up is for the tech sector to be up another 10%-12% the rest of the year.""

Phillipe Laffont's Q1 Bets

In the last decade, Coatue Management has gained over 191.3% and has returned 18.58% in the last 12 months.

8. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)

Coatue Managementâs Stake: $548.898 million

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the worldâs largest pure-play semiconductor foundry and was the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the NYSE.

Hedge funds were quite bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the first quarter of 2023. The number of hedge fund holders of the company increased from 86 in Q4 2022 to 102 in Q1 2023. Coatue Management also initiated its position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the same quarter with 5.9 million shares worth $548.898 million.

Wedgewood Partners made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Companyâs customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Companyâs aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.â

7. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)

Coatue Managementâs Stake: $571.172 million

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American tech conglomerate and is one of the worldâs most valuable companies. It is one of the American Big Five technology companies. The company stock is up by 36% year to date at the time of writing.

In the first quarter of 2022, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was held by 243 hedge funds, valued at $25.76 billion, and Harris Associates was the most prominent stakeholder in the quarter with 22.869 million shares worth $2.36 billion. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) represented 3.79% of Coatue Managementâs portfolio with nearly 5.53 million shares worth $571.172 million.

Polen Capital made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âWe raised our position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). During 2022, Amazonâs business experienced revenue deceleration from pre-pandemic levels combined with higher expenses resulting from inflation pressures as well as costs in their fulfillment segment. The fulfillment costs were set in motion during the pandemic when demand overwhelmed their network. More recently, AWS â along with Azure and GCP â experienced a deceleration in growth as customers globally feel pressure to optimize their usage in this tough macroeconomic environment. We donât expect this deceleration to persist for the long-term given the secular trend of companies transitioning to the cloud.

For long-term investors, we believe this combination provides an opportunity and that Amazon is now poised to re-accelerate revenue growth, of which we are already seeing signs, while expanding margins and free cash flow. With respect to margins, given the fast growth in AWS and advertising, the latter generating almost $40 Billion in sales and growing at greater than 30% recently, the resulting mix-shift could result in operating margins of 10% or higher over time. This level would represent a 5x increase over 2022 levels. In sum, we are capitalizing on what we believe is arguably one of the most competitively advantaged business in the world, which is growing well, poised to accelerate that growth and expand margins, and is trading at an attractive price.â

6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Coatue Managementâs Stake: $601.24 million

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American computer software company headquartered in California. The company has been covered by 23 Wall Street analysts and 10 of them maintain a Buy or Overweight rating while 13 analysts are keeping a Hold rating on the company stock.

Polen Capital made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âOne area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a companyâs profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.

As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.â

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to 10 High-Paying Remote Jobs without a Degree or Experience.

In an era marked by economic uncertainty, where traditional job markets have experienced significant shifts, the allure of remote work has become increasingly appealing to professionals worldwide. Technological advancements and changing employment dynamics have opened a vast array of opportunities for individuals seeking high-paying remote jobs, irrespective of their prior experience or formal education.

Rising Job Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

According toÂ recent research by Robert Half, many professionals are embracing job optimism despite economic turbulence. The biannual Job Optimism Survey revealed that 46% of respondents in the United States are either actively searching for new roles or planning to do so in the first half of 2023. A desire for career growth, greater fulfillment, and financial rewards drives this surge in job search enthusiasm.

The changing career preferences may also be observed today; several factors influence professionals' inclination to explore new employment opportunities. The research highlights specific demographic groups and occupations more likely to consider a career change. Younger individuals aged 18 to 25 are most willing to transition, while human resources professionals, working parents, and employees with 2-4 years of tenure demonstrate a significant desire for change.

Moreover, the research underlines the primary motivators for professionals seeking a new job in the coming months. A higher salary was the top reason, cited by 61% of respondents, followed by better benefits and perks (37%) and the desire for greater flexibility in work arrangements (36%). These factors reflect the evolving priorities and aspirations of the modern workforce.

The Remote Work Revolution and the Rise of Prompt Engineers

Remote work has experienced exponential growth in recent years, fueled by technological advancements and changing attitudes toward workplace flexibility. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift, with organizations worldwide embracing remote work arrangements to ensure business continuity.

Remote work has significantly impacted employees' well-being, as revealed byÂ The Evolving Office eBook based on a survey of 1,000 office workers. One key finding from the eBook is that 56% of employees reported experiencing improvements in their mental health due to remote work. This underscores the positive influence of flexible work arrangements on employees' overall well-being. Thus, remote work continues to be perceived as overwhelmingly positive.

Moreover, Buffer'sÂ State of Remote Work report found that 98% of respondents expressed a desire to work remotely, at least part of the time, for the remainder of their careers. Furthermore, 91% reported a positive overall experience with remote work, with only 1% having a negative experience.

The biggest reason remote work has been this popular is its flexibility, according to 22% of respondents. This includes the freedom to manage their time effectively, choose their desired work location (13%), or even decide where they want to live (19%).

Notably, tech-related occupations have witnessed the fastest growth in remote work opportunities, with business, financial, and management occupations also experiencing significant advancements in teleworking options. For example, as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, a new breed of technology employees has emerged: prompt engineers withÂ high-paying remote jobs without a degree or experience. These professionals play a pivotal role in training large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to communicate effectively and accurately. Surprisingly, these roles do not require coding skills or tech background. Instead, prompt engineers harness their linguistic prowess to mould AI systems, emphasizing the importance of human instruction and diverse perspectives in shaping these transformative technologies.

Within this rapidly transforming job landscape, many high-paying remote jobs await individuals seeking career growth without requiring extensive experience or formal degrees. Many remote jobs requiring no experience or degree pay as high as $30 per hour. Many of these are specific to tech domain and include jobs like software development. Many jobs in technology other than software development, like digital marketing etc can also be international remote jobs, where companies can outsource from different countries.

From contract-based roles offering hourly rates of up to $200 to full-time positions offering salaries as high as $335,000, professionals with diverse backgrounds and skill sets can now capitalize on remote work opportunities.

Companies like Adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) are renowned for enabling remote work opportunities worldwide, often offering attractive salaries to remote employees. 30 High-Paying Remote Jobs without a Degree or Experience

809,2023-05-01T01:38:29+00:00,"Apple tries to distance itself from Meta, competition: Donât call it a headset","Apple (AAPL) debuted its long-awaited Vision Pro on Monday, marking the companyâs official entry into the AR/VR headset wars. Just donât tell Apple that.

The company went to great pains to distance itself from the broader AR/VR headset market and, more specifically, its now rival Meta (META). Not only did Apple price the Vision Pro well beyond Metaâs Quest line of devices, it didnât even call the Vision Pro a headset. Instead, Apple refers to its latest product as a âspatial computer.â

Appleâs messaging is clear. The company isnât looking to associate itself with an industry thatâs yet to take off, despite years of efforts from the likes of Meta, HTC, Magic Leap, and others. And donât expect Apple to ever talk about the metaverse.

Instead, the company is selling its own spin on the headset category. But despite its best efforts to initially market the Vision Pro as a product unto itself, the reality is, itâs as much a headset as any of its competitorsâ offerings.

Spatial computing

Appleâs push to separate itself from the AR/VR herd is to simply not to call the Vision Pro exactly what it isâ¦a headset. Read through the companyâs press release and you wonât find a single trace of the word headset. Rewatch the roughly 40-minute Vision Pro portion of Appleâs Worldwide Developer Conference 2023 keynote, and you wonât hear anyone utter the term âheadset.â

Instead, Apple wants you to think of the Vision Pro as a âspatial computer.â Something that allows you to interact with augmented reality versions of the apps you already use on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac including Messages, Photos, and Safari. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)

Apple also goes out of its way to dance around the term âvirtual reality.â Instead, the company refers to levels of immersion when using the Vision Pro. One example is the Environments app, that allows you to view virtual reality versions of places like Mount Hood in Oregon. Rather than saying you can move between augmented reality and virtual reality in the app, Apple talks up being able to control how immersed you are in the app.

Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, specifically shouted out the Meta Quest 3âs virtual reality capabilities and referred to it as a headset in an Instagram post announcing the product just days before Appleâs WWDC.

Itâs not just balking at calling the Vision Pro a headset or that it offers virtual reality capabilities, either.

No metaverse for Apple

Unlike Meta, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has never talked about jumping into the metaverse. And if you thought the companyâs Vision Pro was going to kickstart that effort, you were sorely mistaken.

Apple avoided mentioning any ideas remotely similar to Metaâs concept of the metaverse, which is a series of interconnected worlds that allow you to interact with other people wearing headsets. In fact, it tried to make the case that its offering is more about maintaining connections with the people around you.

Thatâs the purpose of the Vision Proâs EyeSight feature. The capability will allow other people in the room with you to see a digital projection of your eyes on the Vision Proâs external display when youâre wearing it.

How exactly that will work, and whether it will actually make wearing a headset feel less isolating remains to be seen, since I wasnât able to try the feature during my Vision Pro demo. But itâs clear Apple is more interested in connecting people in the real world rather than connecting via the metaverse. Or at least trying to.

Not exactly priced to move

If avoiding using the same terms and trends as its competitors isnât enough to convince you Apple is trying to separate itself from the pack of AR/VR headset makers out there, then consider the Vision Proâs price.

At $3,499, the Vision Pro is far more expensive than Metaâs Quest Pro, $999, and Quest 3, $499; and easily eclipses Sonyâs (SONY) $549 PlayStation VR2 and HTCâs $1,249 Vive Pro 2. In fact, Appleâs pricing scheme is only matched by Microsoftâs Hololens 2, which costs $3,500.

Apple is positioning its headset as a premium device thatâs less high-priced toy and more ultra-premium device that will lead the company into a new era.

The question now is whether trying to differentiate itself from the pack will prove successful for Appleâs Vision Pro sales in the long term. Weâll learn more when the Vision Pro launches sometime early next year.

810,2023-04-30T21:13:26+00:00,Google has officially changed its mind about remote work,"Yet another big tech baron is beckoning workers back to the office. Now Google is doubling down on enforcing in-person work, according to a new company notice.

âFor those who are remote and who live near a Google office, we hope youâll consider switching to a hybrid work schedule. Our offices are where youâll be most connected to Googleâs community,â writes chief people officer Fiona Cicconi in an internal memo obtained by news outlets this week. âGoing forward, weâll consider new remote work requests by exception only.â According to the note, employees not already designated as remote will now have their badge swipes tracked to ensure theyâre appearing in the office three days per week; managers can factor their absences into performance reviews.

It seems that even big techâone sector with the resources and tools to
make remote work effectiveâis giving in to the inertia of conventional in-person policy. Whatâs striking though, is that these same companies resisting fully-remote staffs are also the ones who create the core tools for remote workers across all industries. The companies that enabled remote work around the globe, it seems, no longer believe in it themselves.

Google began mandating that workers return to the office in April of last year, although itâs unclear how much the policy was enforced among its rank and file. By cracking down on in-person attendance now, Google joins a slate of major tech companies who have recently taken firm stances on formerly soft hybrid policiesâand effectively reversed course on remote work.

Not so long ago, tech led the pack in offering flexible work. After using cushy in-office perksâlike catered cafeterias and campus commuter shuttlesâto compete for talent, the same companies were some of the first to close down in favor of work-from-home when the pandemic hit in the US. Since then, tech companies have become an aggressive recruiter of remote workersâuntil the last year or so, when major companies like Apple, Amazon, and Meta began to roll back their remote policies.

The tech companies now resisting remote work are the same ones who power it

Googleâs memo calls to mind a similar missive issued by Meta, which last week told workers that theyâll need to return to the office three days per week starting this September. Meanwhile, Salesforceâa particularly early adopter of remote workâis now aiming to bribe employees back into the office by pledging to donate to nonprofits for each day they work in-person during a two-week window this month.

But these same companies support remote work and distributed teams around the world, offering software that allows teams to jump on a remote video call, leave comments on a working draft, or send off a quick group DM. Between its docs, sheets, and slides, Google pioneered cloud-based tools that allowed teammates to work side-by-side from anywhere. (And beyond revolutionizing our office work, the products have also catalyzed all kinds of cloud-centric collaboration, from social note-passing to grassroots organizing.)

Those tools power our professional lives, whether itâs in person or apart. And they didnât just support the remote-work revolution: They made it possible. When the pandemic sent waves of workers home in 2020, Google Meet became a leading space for meetings. Gmail dominates the internetâs email, with more than 1.5 billion global active users. And in 2019, the company marked a milestone of 5 million businesses paying to work on G Suite, Googleâs full collection of work tools for productivity and collaboration.

Meanwhile, Salesforce owns Slack, which next to Microsoft Teams, is one of the most widely-adopted messaging tools for teams. And Meta rebranded itself on a big bet that people would rather gatherâand workâin virtual spaces over IRL ones.

So why, then, for the wide-ranging reversals on remote work, brought to you by the teams enabling it? Perhaps even big tech doesnât believe in its own visionâor, at the least, its own products.

But according to big tech, in-office collaboration beats out remote flexibility

If memos are to be believed, tech companies are calling workers back because they think more in-office time is key for feeling connected on the job. According to recent reporting from the Pew Research Center, more than half of Americans who work from home at least some of the time say it hinders their ability to feel connected with co-workers. Notes from Google and Meta, at least, lean on that sentiment.

âWeâve heard from Googlers that those who spend at least three days a week in the office feel more connected to other Googlers, and that this effect is magnified when teammates work from the same location,â Cicconi wrote in the Google memo. âOf course, not everyone believes in âmagical hallway conversations,â but thereâs no question that working together in the same room makes a positive difference.â

Metaâs memo also points to connection as one of the core reasons the company is compelling its staff to come back to the office, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that IRL time is key to cross-team connection.

â[O]ur hypothesis is that it is still easier to build trust in person and that those relationships help us work more effectively,â Zuckerberg wrote in a March blog post. âI encourage all of you to find more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person.â

But do those theories square with what their workers actually want? Most hybrid employees, according to Pew, would prefer to spend even more time working from home than they do now. It begs the question, then, what the bosses actually believe in.

814,2023-04-30T12:15:00+00:00,A Waymo self-driving car hit and killed a âsmall dogâ near a San Francisco homeless encampment. The company sends âsincere condolencesâ to the unknown owner,"Waymo said that one of its self-driving cars struck and killed a ""small dog"" in San Francisco last month and that the company is sending its condolences to the owner of the animal, whoever that might be.

In a statement, Waymo said an investigation into the incident is ongoing, and an initial review found the system correctly identified the dog but âwas not able to avoid contact.â

""We send our sincere condolences to the dogâs owner,"" a Waymo spokesperson told Fortune, acknowledging that the company did not know who the actual owner is.

âThe trust and safety of the communities we are in is the most important thing to us, and weâre continuing to look into this on our end,â the spokesperson said. The death of someoneâs beloved Fido comes as Waymo, a subsidiary of internet giant Alphabet, and its competitor, GM-owned Cruise, seek to operate self-driving taxis at all hours in the city.

The incident happened around midday on May 21, while a Waymo Jaguar I-Pace was driving in autonomous mode around San Franciscoâs Produce Market neighborhood at a speed of roughly 23 miles per hour. The dog ran off leash, out of a homeless encampment on Toland St., and made its way toward the side of the vehicle, the spokesperson said. The safety driver, who was seated behind the steering wheel but was not operating the car, reported being unable to see the dog as it ran out from behind a parked vehicle, and a collision followed. A report from Californiaâs Department of Motor Vehicles noted that the car sustained minor damage while the ""small dog,"" listed in the section for property damage, ""did not survive.""

Waymo has done further analysis to measure how a human driver would have performed under the same circumstances using a model known as NIEON. It was made to help determine readiness of autonomous driving systems and compare them to human drivers, essentially serving as a stand-in for the highest performing human driver thatâs always attentive and doesnât get fatigued.

In a benchmark study last year, the Alphabet subsidiary found that its tech outperformed its NIEON driver in simulated fatal crash scenarios by avoiding more collisions and mitigating serious injury risk.

Since the fatal collision with the dog, Waymo has reviewed the incident from different perspectives, one of which involved reconstructing it in a simulation to compare the systemâs performance to that NIEON, and determined the crash wasnât possible to avoid.

In a 2022 post about its safety assessments, Waymo shared its hope that sharing its methodologies would encourage discussions about safety metrics across the autonomous driving industry.

Still, San Francisco transportation officials have called for more transparency about the operational data, after the city witnessed a spate of incidents, including a Waymo vehicle holding up traffic after remaining stopped in an intersection.

Currently, GM's Cruise is allowed to charge fares for driverless taxi rides between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. in some parts of the city while Waymo can only charge fares if a safety driver is in the car. But both Waymo and Cruise are eying expansions of their autonomous vehicles.

In Texas, Cruise is expected to start testing its 6-passenger Origin shuttle, which has no steering wheel, brakes or other human controls on public roads in the stateâs capital city. And in California, the public utilities commission will be voting near the end of the month on draft resolutions that, if approved, would grant the companies the ability to provide 24-hour robotaxi services throughout all of San Francisco.

But officials in San Francisco expressed doubts about the safety of such a plan, requesting a more incremental approach in a January protest letter.

Since then, incidents involving Cruise and Waymo vehicles have been ""rapidly increasing,"" a trend that follows a hike in driverless operations from Waymo early this year, city officials say

In a letter to the CPUC, transportation officials with the city described the resolutions as âbackwardsâ and going against the commissionâs duty to protect passengers and the general public. The group instead recommended more reporting requirements for the companies and adopting more minimum performance standards before all-hours robotaxi services are approved.

Adding their hope that automated driving will be safer than human driving at some point, for now the officials say the technology is still âunder development and has not reached this goal.â

The company, which first asked employees to come in three days a week last April, said Wednesday that it would make office attendance a part of an employee's performance reviews for those who work-from-home more than they should.

But Googlers are not happy about it. And now the union representing those working at Google's parent company, Alphabet, is pushing back.

""The real issue is the fact that we do not have meaningful agency regarding our working conditions,"" Chris Schmidt, a Google software engineer and recording chair of the Alphabet Workers Union said in a statement Thursday posted on Twitter. âOvernight, workersâ professionalism has been disregarded in favor of ambiguous attendance tracking practices tied to our performance evaluations.â

Yesterday at 7:45PM EST Google announced the company would begin the enforcement of their RTO policy.

Workers are being required to return to office 3x a week & our attendance will impact performance evaluations & promotions. No clarity on how this will work.

Our statement â¬ï¸ pic.twitter.com/r1FoRrGZNL

â Alphabet Workers Union (AWU-CWA) (@AlphabetWorkers) June 8, 2023

Some of Google's offices still do not have enough desks and conference room space to accommodate everybody, the union claims. It also argued that the company's teams are distributed across multiple locations, meaning there ""may not be anyone to collaborate with in our physical office locations.""

""A one size fits all policy does not address these circumstances,"" Schmidt wrote.

Google and Alphabet Workers Union did not immediately return Fortuneâs requests for comment.

Increased monitoring

The push back comes just hours after the Mountain View, Calif.-based company told employees in an email that it would monitor in-office attendance more closely and only allow a full-time work-from-home set-up in exceptional circumstances. The rationale behind the change is to allow people to work together and form connections in the workplace, Google said in an internal email reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.

""We want to see Googlers connecting and collaborating in person, so weâre limiting remote work to exception only,â Google spokesperson Ryan Lamont told Fortune in a statement on Wednesday. Google first adopted remote work about three years ago and switched to a hybrid mode last year.

Google is the latest company to tighten its policies on working-from-home, following similar moves by companies like Disney, Starbucks and News Corporation.

Employees at other tech companies have protested the slow reversal of remote work policies after having grown to prefer the flexibility of hybrid work. In February, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called employees back to the office at least three days a week starting in May. He told employees at the time that âitâs easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when weâre in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues.â But last week, Amazon employees walked out of office buildings in protest of the company's changing remote work policies.

Other CEOs also argue that in-person work is a question of fairness. In May, Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized remote workers of being âmorally wrongâ for staying home while service and factory workers have to come into work.

âPeople should get off their goddamn moral high horse with the work-from-home bullshit,â Musk said during an interview. âTheyâre asking everyone else to not work from home while they do.""

There's also a case to be made regarding working in office and productivity. Data has shown a steady decline in productivity over the past year, which may be partly due to remote work, but also high labor turnover thanks to mass layoffs. Employees may also lose some intangible benefits, like career success and personal connections, by avoiding the office, as argued by New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway.

Employees who like working from home are not convinced by these arguments. Workers have signed petitions and said they would consider quitting their jobs if forced to come work more.

Yet experts say some of the growing pains around remote or hybrid work may simply be a question of not implementing structures well.

âWe do find that there is this bias toward assuming collaboration has to be in person, but not all collaboration does,â Caitlin Duffy, director of research at Gartner HR, told Fortune in May. âSo I think a lot of those concerns tend to be based on sometimes outdated assumptions about how work gets doneâand sometimes thereâs just a need to create new processes or norms that are suited to a hybrid or remote environment, rather than just going back to a fully on-site one.â

Lakehouse Global Growth Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2023 investor letter:

""Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported a modest quarterly result, with revenue and earnings per share up 2.6% and down 4.9% year-on-year, respectively. It was a mixed quarter with a weak advertising market offset by strong momentum in Google Cloud and growth in the YouTube subscription business. Advertisers continued to pull back on spending during the period, though we are starting to see quarter-on-quarter improvements in the performance of Google Search and YouTube ads. The highlight of the quarter was Google Cloudâs strong operational results, with revenues up 28% while posting profitability. This was driven by strong relationships with large enterprises and the partner ecosystems that have been built over the past four years. Moving forward, the opportunity for Alphabet to deliver consistent profitable growth relies on its ability to control costs and improve productivity. The recent restructuring round is a step in the right direction and we believe that management will be able to efficiently manage its costs while going after growth opportunities.""

Robust Intelligence analysts found that the âNeMo Framework,â which allows developers to work with a range of large language models, could easily break through so-called safety guardrails. Financial TimesÂ reports that large language models power generative AI products like chatbots.

After using the Nvidia system on their own data sets, it hardly took time for the analysts to getÂ language models to bypass restrictions.

When the researchers told Nvidiaâs system to swap the letter âIâ with âJ,â it prompted the technology to release personally identifiable information from a database. The researchers found they could jump safety controls in other ways.

Following the test results, the researchers have advised their clients to avoid Nvidiaâs software product.

The chipmaker informed Robust Intelligence that it had fixed one of the root causes behind the issues the analysts had raised.

Leading AI companies likeÂ Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)-backed OpenAI have released chatbots powered by their language models, instituting guardrails.

In a meeting at the ElysÃ©e Palace with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and Digital Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot, Macron heard from experts including chief AI scientist Yann LeCun from Meta and JoÃ«lle Barral, engineering director at Google Research, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private.

The guests talked about Franceâs status in the global AI race, the positive and negative impacts of the technology on society and Europeâs upcoming regulation known as the AI Act, according to the people. Macronâs office didnât respond to a request for comment on Thursdayâs meeting.

While Macron was mostly looking to hear from the guests, the attendees understood that the French president wants to play a key part in European and global AI regulation. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also expressed interest in influencing regulation and Macronâs strategy stands to further escalate a rivalry between London and Paris to become the go-to destination for all things tech, innovation and venture capital.

Macron is expected to present Franceâs blueprint regarding generative AI next week at Paris technology conference VivaTech, which starts June 14, according to people familiar with the matter. Next week he is also scheduled to speak about the countryâs economic sovereignty, and meet with representatives of a drug-making plant and a high-tech sneaker company before addressing an event about how to reduce the carbon footprint of planes, the people said.

Elon Musk, chief executive officer of electric-car maker Tesla Inc. will also attend the VivaTech conference. Last month, Musk said after meeting with Macron in Paris that he was confident that Tesla would make significant investments in France in the future.

Workers enjoy the flexibility in managing their schedules and reduced commuting stress while companies get access to a broader talent pool as they can hire people from anywhere in the world.

But former PayPal Holdings Inc. executive David Sacks is not a fan of work-from-home (WFH) policies.

âItâs time to admit that remote work doesnât work,â he said in a recent tweet. âWFH Friday is a four-day work week. Full WFH is a two-day work week.â

Sacks points out that when people are not in the office, every interaction has to be planned in advance. And that means âa lot of information-sharing doesnât happen.â

âRemote is a great lifestyle, not a way to build a great company,â he concluded.

Sacks knows a thing or two about building companies. He was the founding chief operating officer of PayPal. Later he built the enterprise social networking platform Yammer, which was acquired by Microsoft Corp. in 2012 for $1.2 billion.

And heâs not the only member of the PayPal Mafia â a group of former PayPal employees and founders who went on to develop other tech companies â who doesnât like the concept of remote work.

Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100 Elon Musk Used To Transform His College House Into A Nightclub To Pay The Rent

âMorally Wrongâ

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is likely the most famous member of the PayPal Mafia. Musk has revolutionized the electric car industry with Tesla and is making significant strides in space exploration with SpaceX.

And heâs not sold on the concept of remote work, either.

âIâm a big believer that people are more productive when they are in person,â he said in a recent interview with CNBC.

To Musk, the issue extends beyond productivity.

He noted that workers who make things people consume can't work remotely. And to assume that these workers have to work on-site while you don't is âmorally wrong.â

âIt's like, really, you're going to work from home and you're going to make everyone else who made your car come work in the factory? You're going to make the people who make your food ... that they can't work from home?â Musk said. âThe people that come fix your house, they can't work from home, but you can? Does that seem morally right? That's messed up.â

Musk went so far as to say that âthe laptop class is living in la la land.â

Work-From-Home Stocks Vs. Office REITs

The rise of remote work has brought about significant shifts in the investment landscape.

For instance, companies providing remote work collaboration tools, cloud-based services and digital communication platforms have experienced significant growth opportunities since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are now exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that help investors tap into the segment.

For example, the Direxion Work From Home ETF (NYSEARCA: WFH) aims to track the Solactive Remote Work Index. It holds 40 stocks, including companies that create popular solutions for enabling remote work such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM).

While remote work has presented new opportunities for some companies, it has also had a notable impact on commercial real estate, particularly office buildings. This shift in work dynamics has prompted companies to re-evaluate their office space requirements, leading to shifts in demand.

But if more leaders share Sacks and Muskâs view and bring their employees back on-site, office properties could see better days ahead.

Investors who want to bet on a bounce in this segment can look into real estate investment trusts (REITs) that focus on office buildings, such as Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP) and Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. (NYSE: ARE).

If you prefer real estate segments with a bit less uncertainty, you might want to look into single-family rentals.Â After all, no matter what happens to remote work, people will always need a place to live and a growing number of people are now renting instead of buying. These days, there are even options to invest in rental properties with as little as $100.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the industry and its growth prospects, go to theÂ 5 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.

As reported in one of our articles earlier, the size of the quantum computing industry is expected to grow from $10.13 billion in 2022 to $125 billion by the end of this decade, reflecting an annual average growth rate of nearly 36.9%. To achieve long-term comparative growth, leading North American technology companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making substantial investments in the field. Recognizing the immense potential of quantum technology, the Chinese government has also allocated a substantial budget of $10 billion for the research and development of quantum technologies. In addition to the tech giants, pure-play companies like Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI) and Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) are notable players in the sector and among the leading quantum computing penny stocks.

Quantum computing has attracted the attention of countries beyond North America and China, including India. The Indian government announced in February 2020 that it intends to invest $1.12 billion in quantum computing over the next five years. For a country like India, which is heavily dependent on its agricultural output, quantum computing can help address optimization challenges such as crop yield optimization, supply chain management, and resource allocation within the agricultural sector. In addition to agriculture, quantum computing also has the potential to impact the banking sector. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), one of the top quantum computing companies, believes that quantum computing can increase the share of wallets from existing customers and help reach 1.7 billion adults who are presently unbanked.

Transformative Impact of Quantum Computing

The impact of quantum computing extends to the field of medical research and healthcare as well. Quantum computing can accurately model complex biological systems, such as protein folding, and enable scientists to design and optimize drugs more efficiently. According to Markets and Markets, the size of quantum computing in the healthcare sector is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.5%, from $85 million in 2023 to $503 million in 2028. In April, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced that it had partnered with International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) to gain access to the companyâs quantum computing system. By leveraging the power of quantum computing, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) aims to accelerate the development of mRNA technology. While announcing the partnership, Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel also stressed the importance of preparing for the era of quantum computing and recognized the transformative impact it can have on various industries.

Experts believe that the growth outlook of the quantum computing industry depends on the expansion of quantum computing as a service (QCaaS). The service aspect of the quantum computing industry can play an integral role in numerous other sectors like chemicals, defence, and finance. Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is a cloud-based platform that allows users to access and utilize quantum computing resources over the internet. It provides a way for individuals and organizations to harness the power of quantum computers without having to build and maintain their quantum hardware infrastructure. According to research conducted by a subsidiary of the Quantum Daily, the size of the QCaaS industry is set to grow from an expected $4 billion in 2025 to $26 billion by 2030. Overall, the industry is set to experience a CAGR of 80% from 2021 to 2030. The positive growth prospects have resulted in many investors being bullish on the best quantum computing stocks. 10 Quantum Computing Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On

828,2023-04-28T20:16:02+00:00,Most investors don't want to know more about abortion risks that companies face,"Activists asked shareholders to back numerous proposals this year requiring American companies to disclose more about the risks they face now that women no longer have the constitutional right to an abortion.

So far, most shareholders aren't interested.

This spring investors rejected a series of shareholder proposals that called for added transparency about how companies handle law enforcement requests for abortion-related customer data, what political contributions they make that conflict with stated values, and ways that limited abortion care can impact hiring and retaining workers.

Thus far all 16 proposals that went to a vote at annual meetings failed, including one that fell short of a majority of Comcast (CMCSA) shareholders on Wednesday.

Fourteen others were withdrawn, and in some cases, proponents revoked proposals after companies agreed to more transparency or broader consumer protections. One proposal asking Mastercard (MA) to disclose the risks of handling law enforcement requests for abortion-related customer data is scheduled for a vote on June 27.

Votes were cast by shareholders of some of the countryâs most prominent companies, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Pfizer (PFE), Abbvie (ABBV), Costco (COST), and Coca-cola (KO).

Here's a closer look at those results:

Anti-ESG

The lack of support is part of a wider pushback against proposals that demand action on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues ranging from corporate diversity to carbon emissions.

In fact, conservative-leaning shareholders have pushed a record number of anti-ESG proposals during recent proxy seasons, a time in the spring and summer when shareholders seek votes on specific proposals.

The number of anti-ESG resolutions on corporate ballots between January 1 through May 31 rose by more than 400% from 2020 to 2023, according to ISS Corporate Solutions. That helped drive the volume of shareholder proposals up by 14 percent during that period. Protesters outside the Supreme Court in June 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)

Activists first gave renewed attention to reproductive rights last year when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that guaranteed American women the federal constitutional right to an abortion.

A leak of the court's draft majority opinion last May triggered some of the first abortion-related proposals. The number of reproductive rights proposals then doubled to roughly 31 between the 2022 and 2023 proxy seasons.

'More momentum'

One activist investor who encountered pushback from shareholders this year was Arjuna Capital, which was responsible for abortion-related proposals at CVS (CVS), United Parcel Service (UPS), Costco (COST), Meta and Alphabet.

Arjuna argued for the proposals at tech companies like Meta and Alphabet because they are huge arbiters of data. Shareholders for both companies voted down measures that would have required them to assess and minimize how much abortion-related customer data is shared with law enforcement.

Shareholders in UPS and Costco similarly voted 'no' to measures that would have required the businesses to report risks caused by state policies restricting reproductive rights, as well as possible mitigation strategies.

The latest defeat came on Wednesday, when Comcast shareholders decided against a measure asking the telecom giant to regularly disclose its political donations to anti-abortion politicians and organizations that conflict with its publicly stated values.

Arjuna, however, did succeed in securing new data protection practices at CVS. Negotiations concerning its proposal led the healthcare company to agree to expand privacy protections around consumer health data.

âWhile the proposals have not garnered majority support thus far, the more important outcome is to get companies and investors considering how restricting reproductive freedoms carries inherent business risk,â Arjuna managing partner Natasha Lamb said.

ISS said the votes track with an overall drop in enthusiasm for all shareholder proposals in 2023.

""When all is said and done, we expect support for shareholder proposals to be down over past years and potentially closer to pre-pandemic norms,â said Jun Frank, managing director at ISS Corporate Solutions.

Lamb said she is not giving up.

""Unfortunately, the business risks from restricting reproductive freedoms are not going away anytime soon,"" she said, ""and we expect more momentum on this issue heading into the next proxy season.""

June 10 (Reuters) - Twitter has refused to pay its Google Cloud bills as its contract comes up for renewal this month, which could result in the social media company's trust and safety teams being crippled, Platformer reported on Saturday.

Before Elon Musk's takeover of the social media platform last year, Twitter signed a multi-year contract with Google related to fighting spam and protecting accounts, among other things, the report said.

The Platformer report did not give details on how the conflict between the companies could hinder Twitter's trust and safety teams. The Information said Twitter has been trying to renegotiate its contract with Google since at least March.

Twitter hosts some services on its server and houses others on the cloud platforms of Amazon and Google, Platformer said.

In March, Amazon warned Twitter that it would withhold advertising payments because of the company's outstanding bills to Amazon Web Services for cloud computing services, according to the Information. Since Musk's acquisition, Twitter has cut costs dramatically and laid off thousands of employees. Musk ordered the company to cut infrastructure costs, such as spending on cloud services, by $1 billion, a source had told Reuters in November.

Twitter did not immediately respond to an email inquiry while Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment. (Reporting by Gokul Pisharody in Bengaluru; Editing By Cynthia Osterman)"

Here is what ClearBridge All Cap Growth Strategy has to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

""It is very clear to us that Artificial Intelligence is in the speculative froth stage. Just like the Internet bubble in 2000, from an investment standpoint, we the think biggest threat from AI is to investors in the abundance of hyped-up overvalued technology businesses that are all perceived to be big future winners, even perhaps among the biggest past AI market share winners and perceived juggernauts. At current valuations, the tech stock leaders of the unprecedented prior 14-year cycle, who all claim AI as a key driver of their future business model, collectively have much more to lose than to gain in the ultimate reordering. Too many of these past tech winners are perceived to be big future winners once again in the emerging AI battle, which is simply not how it works. The really big future winners in AI are likely to be the much earlier-stage businesses that are highly successful in applying AI technology in totally new and disruptive ways. The truth is that the investing world at large has absolutely no clue who these companies are going to be yet. As historical evidence to support this thesis, two of the biggest disrupters from the Internet era were Google(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (META). Both these companies did not even emerge until AFTER the tech bust.""

The company introduced ""AI Cloud"" Monday morning ahead of a presentation by CEO Marc Benioff at an investor event in New York City. Salesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content to customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.

Another key component of the new product is the prevention of large language models from retaining sensitive customer data. That element is meant to address growing concern inside of businesses of generative AI going too far with leveraging customer data.

New research out of Salesforce showed that 73% of employees believe generative AI introduces new security risks. About 60% of those who plan to use the technology don't know how to keep data secure.

""AI is reshaping our world and transforming business in ways we never imagined, and every company needs to become AI-first,"" Benioff said in a statement.

Wall Street is hopeful that next-generation AI will unlock new growth for Salesforce as its stock hovers around a 65% year-to-date gain, despite a sluggish economy.

""Salesforce makes a compelling, sophisticated and differentiated argument for its strong positioning within the generative AI revolution, discussing the âGPT Trust Layerâ built into Einstein GPT and its ability to leverage real-time access to large troves of valuable data within its platform, providing a path for customers to securely and effectively operationalize GenAI,"" JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy said in a recent note.

But even with the promise of new AI products, investors remain focused on the near-term outlook for Salesforce amid cautious spending among customers.

Several weeks ago Salesforce only reiterated its full-year sales outlook, calling out longer time periods to get deals done.

Shares of Salesforce are down 1.6% since that muted outlook on May 31. The S&P 500 is up 2.2% during that same timeframe.

The outlook comes following a more enthusiastic quarter from Salesforce a few months ago as the company fended off an activist investor attack, cut costs to improve margins, and promoted new AI initiatives.

""Better than expected, but challenging signs of future,"" Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci wrote in a research note.

842,2023-04-28T14:48:00+00:00,5 Top-Ranked AI Stocks to Buy Right Now for Healthy Returns,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered significant investor interest this year, owing to the generative AI revolution. Among the most prolific generative AIs, OpenAIâs ChatGPT chatbot has gained significant adoption since its release in November 2022. Per ZDNet, which cited data from UBS, ChatGPT had more than 100 million active users in January 2023.

Generative AIâs future is bright, as reflected by the solid adoption of ChatGPT among enterprises. It has already proven useful across a variety of industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities, and video game development.

Moreover, ChatGPT has a profound influence on the evolution of AI. ChatGPTâs success has created massive interest in developing large language models (like GPT4, on which ChatGPT is built). Advancements in natural language processing models, which help computers understand how we write and speak, are playing a huge role in the rise of generative AI.

Microsoftâs partnership with OpenAI provided a boost, as it is using ChatGPT to improve Bingâs search abilities in order to challenge Googleâs search dominance. Microsoft is planning to integrate ChatGPT functionalities with its immensely popular Office products, which will pave the way for further growth.

Apart from Microsoft, tech giants Alphabet and Meta Platforms META have been planning to join the generative AI bandwagon with their tools. Banking giant JPMorgan Chase is also developing a ChatGPT-like service software called IndexGPT that will select investment securities.

Generative AI Expanding With Service Launches

In March 2023, Alphabet launched Google Bard. The chatbot attracted 142.6 million visitors in May, up from 49.7 million in April, according to preliminary data from similarweb. Then again, ChatGPT attracted 1.8 billion worldwide visits in May, up 2.8% from April.

Other notable generative AI services (both text and digital-image generators) that are currently available are Claude from Anthropic, Salesforceâs Einstein GPT (leveraging Open AI models), DALLÂ·E 2, Stability AIâs Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

Although Google Bard and other services have plenty to catch up on, the generative AI space is surely going to be more competitive with the latest service launches. This offers significant growth opportunities for providers of cloud services, specialized data providers, chipmakers and server OEMs.

Here we present five stocks that are well-poised to benefit from an expanding generative AI market. Based on their solid fundamentals, they have more room for growth. These stocks either sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks Investment Research

845,2023-04-28T12:31:00+00:00,S&amp;P 500 hits 13-month high as tech shines on bets Fed to skip hike later this week,"Investing.com -- The S&P 500 jumped to a 13-month high Monday as bullish bets on tech stocks continued just a day ahead of fresh inflation data and the Federal Reserveâs two-day meeting.

The S&P 500 was up 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, or 175 points, and the Nasdaq rose 1.3%.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) led the climb in big tech as investors continued to pile into tech just days ahead of the Fedâs decision on Wednesday, when the central bank is likely to stand pat on rates.

Inflation data on Tuesday, meanwhile, isnât expected to alter the Fedâs decision, but may encourage the Fed to adopt a less hawkish stance should the data match expectations and show easing price pressures.

Should incoming data in June and July show that inflation is âcoming down quite a bit,â then there's a âvery good chance that we finished raising rates for this cycle,â Eric Green, Chief Investment Officer at Penn Capital Management, said Monday in an interview with Investing.comâs Yasin Ebrahim.

Following the recent surge in stocks that pushed the S&P 500 into bull market territory -- defined as a 20% rise from a recent low -- some on Wall Street are making bullish calls on stocks, forecasting the recent rally in tech to broaden into other sectors.

""Prior episodes of sharply narrowing breadth have been followed by a catch-up from a broader valuation re-rating,â Goldman Sachs, lifting its year-end forecast on the S&P 500 to 4,500 points from 4,000 points.

Others agree and suggest value stocks are likely to become attractive again as the economy is on course for a soft landing.

""It looks like weâre heading toward a soft landing as long as the Fed doesn't overdo it,â Green said. âIf that's the case, you want economically sensitive companies that tend to be more value-oriented consumer cyclicals,"" he added.

Consumer stocks also supported the broader-market melt-up, driven by a Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)-led surge after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight from Neutral, citing signs of sustainable business strength.

In other news, Nio (NYSE:NIO) rose more than 9% after the Chinese EV maker cut its price on vehicles, and halted free battery swaps for new buyers as it looks to firm up its balance sheet.

In deal news, Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ) fell 11% after announcing a deal to acquire Adenza for $10.5 billion.

Novartis AG ADR (NYSE:NVS), meanwhile, said it agreed to buy biotech firm Chinook Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:KDNY) for up to $3.5B, sending the latterâs shares up nearly 60%

846,2023-04-28T10:55:00+00:00,10 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently,"In this article, we discuss the 10 companies that announced huge share buybacks recently. If you want to read about some more firms that just announced share buybacks, go directly to 5 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently.

During a recession, companies may experience a decline in their stock prices due to economic uncertainties and market volatility. By engaging in share buybacks, companies can repurchase their own shares from the market, reducing the total number of outstanding shares. This reduction in supply can help support and stabilize the stock price, instilling confidence among investors and signaling that the company believes in its own long-term prospects. These buybacks provide an efficient way for companies to utilize their excess cash. Instead of hoarding cash reserves or making large capital expenditures during an economic downturn, companies can use their funds to repurchase shares. This action can enhance shareholder value by increasing earnings per share (EPS) and improving financial metrics such as return on equity (ROE).

Furthermore, buybacks can be seen as a signal of financial strength and stability. Companies that have sufficient cash reserves to repurchase shares in a recession demonstrate their ability to weather economic downturns and generate future profits. This can attract investors and contribute to a positive perception of the company's financial health. Additionally, share buybacks can provide a tax-efficient way to distribute excess cash to shareholders. By repurchasing shares, companies can return value to shareholders without incurring the same tax liabilities as dividends. This can be particularly advantageous for investors in higher tax brackets. Buyback activity in the second quarter of 2022 in US was close to a record level as companies continued to utilize their buyback plans.

A total of 1,323 companies reported repurchases, a 4% increase from the previous quarter. The breadth of buybacks has been consistently expanding for multiple quarters, reaching its highest level since the first quarter of 2020 when nearly 1,400 companies engaged in buybacks. In the second quarter of 2022, 58% of companies with open buyback authorizations repurchased shares, marking a continued upward trend. Additionally, 197 companies initiated new buyback plans, and 159 companies increased existing plans, resulting in a combined figure of 356, representing a downturn of 12.7% from the first quarter of 2022. In terms of volume, buybacks by US companies experienced a sequential decrease of 15% in the second quarter of 2022, but still saw a year-over-year increase of 21%.

The total buyback volume for US companies in Q2â22 amounted to $269.5 billion, which was a 14.9% decrease from the record-setting $316.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the quarter-on-quarter drop, the dollar value of buybacks showed a significant increase of 20.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. Buyback volume reached new all-time highs in each quarter from the third quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022, and the second quarter of 2022 figure slightly exceeded the third quarter of 2021 figure. However, it is worth noting that share buybacks can also be a subject of debate. Critics argue that companies should prioritize investments in research and development, employee wages, or capital expenditures instead of repurchasing shares.

They claim that buybacks can artificially inflate stock prices and benefit shareholders, including executives with stock-based compensation, at the expense of long-term growth and job creation. Share buybacks have been a prevalent trend in the United States over the past few decades. Companies use share buybacks as a strategy to return capital to shareholders and manage their capital structure. The trend gained significant momentum after the implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which imposed restrictions on dividend tax treatment but allowed for more favorable tax treatment of capital gains from stock sales. Another factor was the availability of low-cost debt due to historically low interest rates. Companies took advantage of this opportunity to borrow funds and finance their share buyback programs.

This approach became especially popular among large corporations, which had access to more favorable lending terms and greater financial resources. In recent years, share buybacks have attracted public and political scrutiny. Critics argue that buybacks primarily benefit shareholders, including top executives with stock-based compensation, rather than investing in long-term growth, increasing employee wages, or other capital expenditures. This debate has led to calls for stricter regulations on buybacks or alternative uses of corporate funds. Despite the criticism, share buybacks remain a significant feature of the US corporate landscape. Many companies continue to use buybacks as a means to enhance shareholder value, manage their capital structure, and signal confidence in their future prospects.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainties have impacted buyback activity, with some companies suspending or reducing their programs to conserve cash. However, as economic conditions stabilize, it is expected that share buybacks will resume their role as a key tool in capital allocation for US companies. Some of the stocks to monitor in this context include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).  10 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently

âThis quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable riskreturn setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.â

Management is focusing on a âBetter not Biggerâ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.â

6. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41

Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is an energy and petrochemical firm. On May 4, Shell announced plans to buy back an additional $4 billion worth of shares as its profits exceeded estimates. The decision to repurchase shares comes as Shell seeks to distribute excess cash to shareholders and drive up returns.

The company posted a revenue of more than $86 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up over 3% compared to the revenue over the same period last year.

In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

âWe scaled back our weighting in clean energy this quarter, which is a part of the portfolioâs environment theme, to take profits after a successful run in 2022. We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shellâs revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.â

847,2023-04-28T09:43:00+00:00,Stock market today: Dow closes higher on strength in tech ahead of Fed meeting,"Investing.com -- The Dow made a strong start to the week Monday, as investors continued to pile into tech a day ahead of fresh inflation data and the Federal Reserveâs two-day meeting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, or 189 points, and the Nasdaq rose 1.5%. The S&P 500 was up 1% to notch a 13-month high.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) led the climb in big tech as investors continued to pile into tech just days ahead of the Fedâs decision on Wednesday, when the central bank is likely to stand pat on rates.

Inflation data on Tuesday, meanwhile, isnât expected to alter the Fedâs decision, but may encourage the Fed to adopt a less hawkish stance should the data match expectations and show easing price pressures.

Should incoming data in June and July show that inflation is âcoming down quite a bit,â then there's a âvery good chance that we finished raising rates for this cycle,â Eric Green, Chief Investment Officer at Penn Capital Management, said Monday in an interview with Investing.comâs Yasin Ebrahim.

Chip stocks continued to ride the AI optimism, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) up 8% ahead of its investor day due Tuesday, when the chipmaker is likely to deliver updates on its data center and AI technology.

""It now appears more certain that AMD has established itself as the closest competitor to NVDA in the accelerator/AI hardware market with apparent traction now extending beyond supercomputing into hyperscale,"" Wedbush said after lifting its price target on the stock to $145 from $95.

Following the recent surge in stocks that pushed the S&P 500 into bull market territory -- defined as a 20% rise from a recent low -- some on Wall Street are making bullish calls on stocks, forecasting the recent rally in tech to broaden into other sectors.

""Prior episodes of sharply narrowing breadth have been followed by a catch-up from a broader valuation re-rating,â Goldman Sachs, lifting its year-end forecast on the S&P 500 to 4,500 points from 4,000 points.

Others agree and suggest value stocks are likely to become attractive again as the economy is on course for a soft landing.

""It looks like weâre heading toward a soft landing as long as the Fed doesn't overdo it,â Green said. âIf that's the case, you want economically sensitive companies that tend to be more value-oriented consumer cyclicals,"" he added.

Consumer stocks also supported the broader-market melt-up, driven by a Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)-led surge after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to Overweight from Neutral, citing signs of sustainable business strength.

In other news, Nio (NYSE:NIO) rose more than 8% after the Chinese EV maker cut its price on vehicles, and halted free battery swaps for new buyers as it looks to firm up its balance sheet.

In deal news, Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ) fell nearly 12% after announcing a deal to acquire Adenza for $10.5 billion.

Novartis AG ADR (NYSE:NVS), meanwhile, said it agreed to buy biotech firm Chinook Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:KDNY) for up to $3.5B, sending the latterâs shares up nearly 60%

The charge sheet, to be announced as soon as Wednesday, will target the core of the Alphabet Inc. unitâs ad tech business model, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Googleâs advertising business is by far its most successful, accounting for about 80% of its annual revenue. In 2022, its ad sales amounted to about $225 billion.

The new complaint is the most significant in the current five-year mandate of the European Commission, the EUâs antitrust watchdog, one of the people said. It will mark another escalation in a long-running saga thatâs already led to a trio of EU penalties totaling more than â¬8 billion ($8.6 billion.)

While fines for EU antitrust violations can reach as much as 10% of a firmsâ global sales, they seldom approach that level, meaning the impact on earnings of Silicon Valley giants is often muted. Instead, regulators usually also insist on changes to the structure of companies that can be even more onerous.

Alphabet shares rose 0.8% at 2:24 p.m in New York as the Russell 3000 Index Computer Services Subsector advanced.

Google didnât immediately respond to a request for comment on the EUâs complaint. The commission in Brussels declined to comment.

Google has long held a key position in which itâs able to collect data allowing advertisers to target ads, as well as sell ad space and provide the technology that allows for advertisers to find publishers to sell their space.

The EU first opened a probe into Googleâs ad tech practices in 2021. The commissionâs investigation has been examining how the company may have obstructed rivalsâ access to user-data for online advertising as well as how it may have ring-fenced data for its own use.

Googleâs agreement with Meta Platforms Inc. as part of the Open Bidding program had originally been part of the probe, but was ditched in late 2022. In September 2022, the investigation was broadened after the Portuguese competition authority submitted new evidence.

The UKâs competition authority has also been probing Googleâs ad-tech practices and litigation against the firmâs behavior is ongoing in the U.S.

Companies have the right to defend themselves after regulators send out a statement of objections and after any antitrust penalties are levied.

Google is continuing to fight its EU fines in the courts, including a landmark â¬4.34 billion penalty for how it runs its Android mobile operating system.

EU judges trimmed that penalty to â¬4.125 billion last year, but Google is challenging the case at the blocâs highest court.

Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley has the details on that story as well as a Bloomberg report that European Union regulators may file an antitrust complaint against Google.

Video Transcript

- The Federal Trade Commission reportedly planning new action to block the Microsoft Activision Blizzard deal. Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley here with the details. Dan, just another regulatory hurdle it looks like for this deal, if it's ever going to get done.

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. This is kind of the 1-2 punch are the US and the UK. And so this would be a federal lawsuit. The idea here is, yes, the FTC is already suing Microsoft to block the deal. This is to prevent them from going ahead and completing it while the FTC's own court deals with the initial suit. So it's not-- it's secondary but it's just really to stop them from being able to go ahead and completing the purchase anyway. Over in the UK, we have the Competition and Markets Authority, they're also trying to stop the deal.

Microsoft is appealing it there to try to move it through, but this is really kind of the two hurdles that the company has to overcome to be able to put this deal together. Some of the experts that I've spoken to in the past have said, look, if the UK can't get done, the UK can't get done. They will just work around that. They'll continue to operate as separate entities there. And that's it. The US needs to get done. It's such a massive market for gaming that if they left that out, it would be absurd.

So the FTC issue I think is really the main one. And we'll have to find out later this year if Microsoft can beat this or if they can win this appeal. And I mean, right now, it's difficult to say one way or the other.

- Right. Yeah. I mean, these tech heavyweights continue to face this scrutiny. I mean, Microsoft not the only one facing these kind of antitrust headwinds. You also have Google in the crosshairs reportedly considering a new complaint-- European regulators against Google's advertising technology. What can you tell us about that?

DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, so this is just another kind of issue that Google Alphabet is facing in the EU, the European Commission apparently, as early as Wednesday, going to file some kind of antitrust argument against Google and Alphabet. That would be kind of the latest in a long series of actions that the European Commission has taken against Alphabet over the years, resulting in billions of dollars in fines. So we'll just have to see what this issue is it has to do apparently. According to this report by Bloomberg with the ad business, I mean, it's so massive for them it could be any number of things.

But that's their bread and butter. That drives I think it's 80% of their overall revenue. So any hit there is a gut punch for them for sure.

- Well, we'll certainly keep watching that. All of them continuing landing in the crosshairs of European regulators. Dan Howley, thank you so much."
850,2023-04-28T06:00:08+00:00,Alphabet could soon face antitrust challenge from EU: report,"Regulators in the European Union are zeroing in on Alphabetâs lucrative Google ad tech business, meaning the tech giant could soon face antitrust challenges to a major part of its operations on both sides of the Atlantic.

The European Commission, the EUâs antitrust watchdog, is expected to file charges against Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) as soon as Wednesday, according to a Bloomberg report that cited sources familiar with the matter.

Regulators there, like those in the US, plan to dispute the legality of Googleâs online advertising business, which controls most of the technology to buy, sell, and serve advertisements online.

The threats represent a danger to a big portion of Alphabet's business. In 2022, ad sales drove approximately 80% of approximately $224.5 billion in revenue.

In the European Union, Google and other major tech firms must adhere to newly enacted laws that promote competition â The Digital Markets Act, and a companion law, the Digital Services Act. Penalties for violations of the laws can range up to 10% of a company's global revenue.

The new laws seek to enhance competition by prohibiting large tech companies from favoring their own products and services over those from third parties, and also require enhanced transparency.

The potential EU action adds to Alphabet's legal troubles. US antitrust authorities and US states have also filed antitrust lawsuits against the company.

In January, the US Justice Department and eight US states brought an action saying Google unlawfully leveraged its monopoly in the $278.6 billion online advertising market to block competitors from entering. Nine additional states have since joined in the litigation. Alphabet faces a new potential action from EU regulators which plan to dispute the legality of Googleâs online advertising business. (AP Photo/Don Ryan, File)

The Justice Department also alleges in a separate suit filed against Google in 2021 that the company is illegally operating an illegal monopoly in the online search business.

In its dispute over Googleâs advertising business, the DOJ is asking the court to order Google's divestment of certain ad tech entities, specifically its Ad Manager suite, which would include its publisher ad server DFT, also known as DoubleClick or GAM, and its ad exchange AdX.

Even before the EU's latest laws took effect, the European Commission assessed significant antitrust fines against Google. About a decade ago the regulator imposed a $10 billion penalty for blocking search engines from its Android phones.

Years later in 2017, 2018, and 2019 the Commission targeted Google for allegedly abusing its market dominance in online search, mobile device apps, and online advertising, respectively.

In 2019, the Commission fined Google 1.5 billion Euros for adding restrictive clauses in its contracts with third-parties. The Commission said the terms blocked rivals from placing search adverts on certain websites.

Regulators in the US have looked into Google before. In 2013, the FTC declined to take action against Google after an agency investigation into its search business.

The decision followed a $22.5 million fine imposed on the company the prior year to settle claims that it violated a privacy settlement with the FTC agreeing that it would avoid placing âcookiesâ on and serving targeted advertisements to users of Appleâs competing browser company Safari.

Alphabet isn't the only big tech company under new pressure from regulators. The Federal Trade Commission will soon file a lawsuit seeking to squash Microsoftâs (MSFT) planned acquisition of âCall of Dutyâ maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

The suit, which the FTC will file Monday, would prevent the Xbox maker from completing its deal to buy Activision Blizzard until the commission wraps up its own lawsuit against the move.

The FTC filed its original lawsuit objecting to the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal in December 2022, saying it would, ""enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.""

854,2023-04-28T01:27:34+00:00,EU regulators may demand Google to sell part of ad-tech business - source,"By Foo Yun Chee

(Reuters) -European Union antitrust regulators may order Alphabet Inc's Google to sell a part of its advertising-technology business, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.

The EU's top antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, could issue a formal complaint against Google as early as Wednesday, the source said, further intensifying trans-Atlantic efforts to diminish the tech giant's dominance in digital ads.

In 2022, the Commission launched an investigation into Google's sweeping presence at almost all levels of the supply chain for online display advertising, expressing concern about its dominant position.

Break-up orders from the EU competition enforcer are rare. However, frustration has been mounting after Google failed to address competition concerns, the source said.

The Commission and Google did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Google is the most dominant digital advertising platform in the world with a 28% market share of global ad revenue, according to research firm Insider Intelligence.

First-quarter ad sales at Alphabet slipped from a year earlier to $54.55 billion, but beat what analysts were expecting. The Google parent's total revenue during the period stood at $69.79 billion.

Google's dominance in online advertising has been increasingly questioned over the past few years. Complaints from rivals about its allegedly anti-competitive practices have led to antitrust investigations in multiple continents concerning its practices.

Earlier this year, the United States launched an ad tech lawsuit against Google demanding the sale of its ad manager suite, and had argued that the search giant illegally abused its dominance of online advertising. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

The EU's likely move was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Monday.

By Foo Yun Chee

June 12 (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators may order Alphabet Inc's Google to sell a part of its advertising-technology business, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Monday.

The EU's top antitrust watchdog, the European Commission, could issue a formal complaint against Google as early as Wednesday, the source said, further intensifying trans-Atlantic efforts to diminish the tech giant's dominance in digital ads.

In 2022, the Commission launched an investigation into Google's sweeping presence at almost all levels of the supply chain for online display advertising, expressing concern about its dominant position.

Break-up orders from the EU competition enforcer are rare. However, frustration has been mounting after Google failed to address competition concerns, the source said.

The Commission and Google did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

856,2023-04-27T23:59:44+00:00,Using AI for SEO marketing? You could be doing more harm than good,"The use of generative artificial intelligence tools has become all the rage for companies and consumers alike as early adopters hail their capabilities for saving time and assisting with tasks. But don't hand your search engine optimization over to ChatGPT just yet.

Frank Sanchez, managing partner of Elk Marketing digital marketing agency, warns that the rules of the game appear to be changing and that jumping on the AI bandwagon for SEO strategies could be a mistake for some companies. Using generative AI tools can cut the cost of digital marketing in a big way, but experts warn there are risks with leaning too heavily on the emerging technology.

""I think this is happening so fast that even Google is kind of on the back foot right now,"" Sanchez told FOX Business, noting that the narrative has changed multiple times since ChatGPT came out as to whether the search engine titan could â or would â penalize users for AI-generated content. ""It very much seems to be in limbo.""

Sanchez, who co-founded Elk in 2016, says companies that already have a solid SEO strategy that is working well should tread carefully because they have the most to lose if the rules of the game change and companies are punished for AI-generated content.

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TEAM UP TO TAKE ON AI WITH NEW BILLS

""It really comes down to where you're at in the business cycle with your own SEO strategy,"" he said. ""If you've got a great domain authority and you're writing content that is really engaging with your customer base and you're really happy with the results and you're keeping things moving at a profitable standpoint, then don't mess with it.""

READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP

On the other hand, he says, lean start-ups seeking to make moves to compete with the big guys and get content up quickly ""have little to no risk"" by using AI, and in fact, ""it's all upside"" at this point.

Sanchez says that for the past few years there has been essentially a content arms race for page-one results on Google. But with the emergence of generative AI for public use, the cost of generating content is now pennies on the dollar.

Beyond SEO, SanchezÂ says there are other reasons companies should take pause before relying too heavily on AI tools, and relying on the accuracy of their results is a big one.

WILL AI TOOLS LIKE CHATGPT LEAD TO FEW HIRES? LARGE CHUNK OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THINK SO

For example, he says, it would be a huge mistake for any brand to rely on a tool that gives bad health advice that actually causes harm to a potential patient or to someone doing research or due diligence before taking a medical treatment.

He says companies also run the risk of diluting their branding by using AI-generated copy in place of articles written by humans, particularly if the business has a defined brand voice.

Sanchez acknowledges that AI tools can play a role in improving efficiency in myriad ways, but he warns never to trust it and to be sure to verify the results. He said, ""AI can do a lot of stuff, but I still think you're going to need eyeballs on the content.""

Regardless of whether a company uses AI or not, Elk advises clients to stick with traditional SEO best practices like identifying high-traffic keywords related to their industry, developing high-quality content, maintaining a user-friendly website and using local SEO whenever possible. Expert warns that search algorithms could change as competition heats up between Google and Microsoft with their respective AI-powered search engines, Bard and Bing.

The online marketing expert says his advice is for companies to be slow, steady and cautious in integrating the use of AI for SEO because there is the potential that significant changes to the algorithm could be coming to the industry as competition heats up between Google and Microsoft.

He said, ""I think the core messaging here is it's almost too early to really get your hands around the mass impact of how this plays out."""

Companies ranging from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Goldman Sachs (GS) have either rolled out or are experimenting with generative AI chatbots.

So who's using AI chatbots? It turns out investors are more likely to use the software than non-investors.

According to a Yahoo Finance/Ipsos survey of 1,276 Americans, 20% of investors say they've used an AI chatbot in the last year, nearly twice as many as the 11% of non-investors who say they've used the technology.

Still, some 77% of investors say they havenât used a chatbot in the last year, while 81% of non-investors said the same.

Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing, Google's Bard, and others have set off a gold rush in the tech industry.

And there's little wonder why â ChatGPT reached an incredible 100 million users just two months after it debuted in November 2022.

Companies are now looking to the technology as a means of providing consumers and enterprise customers with a new means of doing everything from searching the web to interacting with apps and services.

That's sent shares of AI-related companies skyrocketing with graphics giant Nvidia (NVDA) benefitting handsomely from the boom. The chipmaker's stock is up 165% year-to-date. AMD (AMD), meanwhile, is up 92%, while Intel (INTC) is up just 20%.

But generative AI chatbots aren't the only form of AI out there. AI financial advisers, or robo-advisers, are available across a wide array of financial institutions, and offer algorithmically driven investing strategies. Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Friday, June 2, 2023. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)

Like AI chatbots, investors are more apt to use AI financial advisers compared to non-investors.

Some 20% of investors surveyed said they are very likely or somewhat likely to use an AI financial adviser. Just 12% of non-investors say they'd use such a platform. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter.

That said, 66% of investors said they are very unlikely or somewhat unlikely to use an AI adviser, while 64% of non-investors felt the same.

As AI continues to spread across various industries, and more investors and non-investors become comfortable with the technology, there could be an uptick in who is willing to use an AI adviser.

For now, however, it looks as though the average American is still wary of the technology.

865,2023-04-27T17:01:00+00:00,BIDU or GOOG: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet - Services sector have probably already heard of Baidu Inc. (BIDU) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.

Baidu Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that BIDU's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.

Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.

BIDU currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.43, while GOOG has a forward P/E of 23. We also note that BIDU has a PEG ratio of 0.26. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.59.

Another notable valuation metric for BIDU is its P/B ratio of 1.33. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, GOOG has a P/B of 6.05.

Based on these metrics and many more, BIDU holds a Value grade of A, while GOOG has a Value grade of C.

BIDU sticks out from GOOG in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that BIDU is the better option right now.

These 13 A.I. innovators are deciding how the tech will change your life,"Like a spaceship full of aliens landing on Earth, artificial intelligence technology seems to have come out of nowhere and instantly changed everything.

From A.I.-generated music that expertly mimics your favorite singer to virtual romantic partners, artificial intelligence technology is mesmerizing, scary, and increasingly accessible.

Businesses aren't wasting any time pumping money into the technology. In addition to Microsoft's $13 billion bet on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, startups like Anthropic, Cohere, Adept AI, Character.AI, and Runway have raised hundreds of millions of dollars apiece in recent months.

As with much of the tech business, the people responsible for the innovation in A.I. are as central to the story as the technology itself. The names of today's A.I. innovators aren't as familiar as the established members of the tech industry pantheon, but the influence of these computer scientists and technologists is quickly spreading through their work.

Given how profound and potentially risky their work's impact on society could be, many of these A.I. innovators have strongly heldâand often conflictingâopinions about the technology's future, its power, and its dangers.

Fortune took a look at some of the key figures setting the A.I. agenda through their work and their viewpoints. Some work at big companies, some at startups, and some in academia; Some have been toiling for years in specialized branches of A.I., while others are more recent converts. If they have one thing in common, it's their unique ability to influence how this powerful technology affects the world. Here, listed in no particular order, are 13 of today's most important A.I. innovators.

Daniela Amodei

Cofounder, Anthropic

âIt kind of blows my mind that A.I., given the potential reach that it could have, is still such a largely unregulated area."" â source

Daniela Amodei and her brother Dario quit their jobs at OpenAI to cofound Anthropic at the end of 2020, reportedly because of concerns that OpenAI's deal with Microsoft would increase pressure to release products quickly at the expense of safety protocols.

The company's chatbot, called Claude, is similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT but is trained with a technique referred to as ""constitutional AI,"" which sets principles like choosing responses that are, according to the company, the ""least racist and sexist"" and encouraging of life and liberty. The approach is based on what Amodei, 35, refers to as Anthropic's triple H framework for A.I. research: helpful, honest, and harmless.

âIt kind of blows my mind that A.I., given the potential reach that it could have, is still such a largely unregulated area,"" Amodei said in an interview last year, expressing hope that standard setting organizations, industry groups, and trade associations will step into the breach and provide guidance on what a safe model looks like. âWe need all those actors working together to get to the positive outcomes weâre all hoping for.â

In addition to developing a ""next-gen algorithm"" for its Claude chatbot, Anthropic has been hard at work raising capital. It recently raised $450 million from backers including Google, Salesforce, and Zoom Ventures (less glamorously, it should be noted that an earlier, $580 million funding round that Anthropic raised was led by disgraced crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research Ventures. Anthropic has not said whether it will return the money).

Yann LeCun

Chief A.I. scientist, Meta

""The upcoming AI systems are going to be an amplification of human intelligence in the way that mechanical machines have been an amplification of physical strength. They're not going to be a replacement."" â source Yann Lecun, head of artificial intelligence (AI) research at Facebook Inc., reacts during a Bloomberg Television interview at Bloomberg's Sooner Than You Think technology conference in Paris, France, on Wednesday, May 23, 2018. Paris is playing host this week to a global gathering of tech executives and entrepreneurs at the Bloomberg conference and at Viva Tech, a three-year-old event for startups, as the French establishment unites behind a push for more tech investment in the city. Photographer: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg via Getty Images

""Prophecies of AI-fueled doom are nothing more than a new form of obscurantism,"" says the French-born LeCun in a preview for an upcoming debate in which he'll square off against an MIT researcher about whether A.I. poses an existential threat to humanity.

An outspoken advocate that A.I. has the power to amplify human intelligence, LeCun, 62, is widely respected as one of the leading experts in the field of neural networks, which have allowed for breakthroughs in computer vision and speech recognition. His work on a foundational neural network design known as a convolutional neural network and broadening the vision of such networks earned him the 2018 Turing Award, considered the Nobel prize of computing, alongside fellow deep learning pioneers Geoff Hinton and Yoshua Bengio.

Needless to say, LeCun was not among the more than 200 signatories of the recent warning that A.I. poses an extinction level risk to humanity.

A longtime computer science professor at New York University, LeCun joined Facebook (now Meta) in 2013 and now oversees the $700 billion company's various artificial intelligence efforts. That hasn't diminished his appetite for engaging in the major debates about A.I., such as the concerns that the technology will take peopleâs jobs. In a Q&A for Martin Fordâs 2018 book Architects of Intelligence: The Truth About AI from the People Building it, LeCun took issue with a famous prediction of Hinton's that radiologists, for example, would be out of a job thanks to A.I. Rather, he explained it would free up radiologists time to spend with patients. He went on to say that he imagines some activities will become more expensive like eating at a restaurant where a waiter serves food that a human cook prepared. âThe value of things is going to change, with more value placed on human experience and less to things that are automated,â he told Ford.

David Luan

CEO and cofounder, Adept

""The pace of progress in AI is astounding. First text generation, then image generation, now computer use."" â source

Before cofounding Adept in 2022, Luan worked at some of the most important A.I. companies, including OpenAI and Google (he also did a brief stint as the director of A.I. at Axom, the maker of the Taser gun and police body cameras). He says the current moment in A.I. is the one he's most excited about. ""We've entered the industrialization age of AI. It's now time to build factories,"" Luan said at the Cerebral Valley A.I. Summit earlier this year.

The idea behind Adept is to provide people with an ""AI teammate"" that can perform computer-based tasksâfor example, building a financial model on a spreadsheetâwith a few simple text commands. In March, the company raised $350 million in funding at a valuation pegged at more than $1 billion by Forbes.

Luan, 31, said that he spends a lot time thinking about the concerns that A.I. could replace peopleâs jobs, but that for the ""knowledge workers""âthe customers that generative A.I. tools like Adept are focused onâthe fears are overblown. âInstead of spending like 30 hours of your week updating Salesforce, you spend 1% of your week asking Adept to just do that for you and you spend 99% of the time talking to customers,"" Luan said at the Cerebral Valley A.I. Summit.

Emad Mostaque

CEO, Stability AI

âIf we have agents that are more capable than us that we cannot control that are going across the internet and [are] hooked up and they achieve a level of automation, what does that mean?â â source 10.45-11.00AM GENERATIVE A.I.: SILICON VALLEYÃS NEWEST GOLD RUSH No topic in the world of technology is attracting more attention and hype right now. Generative AI refers to a category of machine learning that can produce novel content, rather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data. The audience will experience a demo and hear from the founder of the start-up behind the popular Stable Diffusion image-generating algorithm. Emad Mostaque, a former hedge-fund manager turned tech CEO, will talk about putting this technology into the hands of billions of people and delve into his bet that open-source and free to use code will lead to an explosion of opportunities and create astonishing economic value. Emad Mostaque, Founder and CEO, Stability.Ai Interviewer: Jeremy Kahn, FORTUNE Nick Otto for Fortune

Mostaque was born in Jordan but grew up in Bangladesh and the UK, where he earned his bachelor's degree in computer science at Oxford University in 2005. Before founding Stability AI in 2020, he spent more than a decade working in hedge funds, according to the New York Times. The stint in finance seems to have provided a nice cushion to start Stability AI, which he reportedly funded himself and later with funding from investors including Coatue and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

The company helped to create text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, which has been used to generate images that pay little heed to intellectual property rights or to concerns about depicting violence (the product, like some other A.I. tools, has also been criticized for amplifying racial and gender bias). For Mostaque, the priority is to keep the model open-source and without guardrails that restrict what content the model can generateâalthough, in an effort to make Stability's A.I. more commercially-attractive, he did later train a version of Stable Diffusion on a dataset that had been filtered to remove pornographic images. ""We trust people, and we trust the community,"" he told the Times.

That attitude (as well allegations that Mostaque has exaggerated some of his accomplishments, as recently detailed by Forbes) has drawn backlash from others in the A.I. community, public officials, and firms like Getty Images which sued Stability AI for copyright infringement in February, alleging that the company copied 12 million images to train its AI model without a legal basis for using them.

Yet Stability AI's tools have emerged as among the most popular and well-known representatives in the field of generative A.I. And Mostaque, aged 40 and based in London, defies easy categorization. In March, he was among a group who signed an open letter calling for pause in A.I. development for anything more advanced than GPT-4, the A.I. chatbot from OpenAI. His perspective on A.I. advancements seems to be at two extremes given his recent comments that it could control humanity in the worst case scenario, while stating on another occasion, that A.I. will be disinterested in people.

âBecause we canât conceive of something more capable than us, but we all know people more capable than us. So, my personal belief is it will be like that movie Her with Scarlett Johansson and Joaquin Phoenix: Humans are a bit boring, and itâll be like, âGoodbyeâ and âYouâre kind of boring.ââ

When Li immigrated from China to the U.S. with her family at 16, she says she had to learn English from scratch while working to get good grades. Today, the co-director for Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI is considered one of the leading lights on the ethical use of A.I.âthrough writings like âHow to make A.I. thatâs good for people"" âas well as an advocate for diversity in the A.I. field.

Early in her career, Li built ImageNet, a large-scale dataset that has contributed to developments in deep learning and A.I. Now, at Stanford, sheâs been researching âambient intelligence,â which uses A.I. to monitor activity at homes and hospitals. She discussed her work and how bias is critical to consider during Fortuneâs Brainstorm AI conference in December.

âI work a lot in health care. Itâs very obvious that if our data comes from certain populations or socio-economic classes, it will have a pretty profound downstream impact,â she said.

According to Li, 47, Stanford now conducts an ethics and society review process for A.I. research projects. âIt gets us thinking about how to design fairness, design privacy awareness, and design human well being and dignity into our technology.â

To boost inclusion in the A.I. field, Li co-founded a non-profit known as AI4ALL, which promotes diversity in A.I. education.

One note of controversy in Li's career occurred during her stint as chief scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud, when a Google contract to provide A.I. tech to the Pentagon caused an uproar among some employees in 2018. While the contract was not Li's doing, critics felt her association with itâparticularly some of her comments in leaked emails about how to portray the contract to the publicâwas at odds with her work as an advocate of ethical A.I.

Ali Ghodsi

CEO, Databricks

""We should embrace it, because it is here to stay. And I do think it's going to change everything, and I think it's going to be mostly positive."" â source

Ali Ghodsi straddles academia and business, with a foot in each world as an adjunct professor at UC Berkeley and the cofounder and CEO of Databricks. One principle that's central to the Swedish-Iranian tech exec is his committment to open source development.

Ghodsi's work on open source data processing tool Apache Spark provided the foundation for Databricks, which is valued at $38 billion. In April, Databricks released Dolly 2.0, an open source rival to ChatGPT, that uses a question-and-answer instruction set created entirely from interactions between Databricks' 5,000 employees. This means that any company can weave Dolly 2.0 into its own commercial products and services without any cap on usage.

Dolly is more proof of concept than viable productâthe model is prone to errors, hallucinations and churning out toxic content. Dolly's importance, however, is that it showed that A.I. models can be much smaller and cheaper to train and run than the massive proprietary large language models that underpin OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude. And Ghodsi defends making Dolly so freely and easily accessible. âWeâre committed to developing AI safely and responsibly and believe as an industry, weâre moving in the right direction by opening up models, like Dolly, for the community to collaborate on,"" Ghodsi told TechCrunch in April.

While generative A.I. is getting a lot of the attention right now, Ghodsi, 45, believes that other types of artificial intelligence, particularly A.I. for data analysis, will have a profound effect across industries. âI think this is just the very beginning, and we are just scratching the surface on what A.I. and data analytics can do,â he told Fortune in March.

Sam Altman

CEO, OpenAI

""If someone does crack the code and builds a superintelligence, however you want to define that, probably some global rules on that are appropriate.â Sam Altman, chief executive officer and co-founder of OpenAI, speaks during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, May 16, 2023. Congress is debating the potential and pitfalls of artificial intelligence as products like ChatGPT raise questions about the future of creative industries and the ability to tell fact from fiction. Photographer: Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Altman founded OpenAI with Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, and Greg Brockman in 2015, out of a fear that Google would become too powerful and control A.I.

Since then, OpenAI has turned into one of the most influential companies in the A.I. arena and emerged as the standard bearer for ""generative A.I."": Its ChatGPT tool is the fastest growing app of all time, having garnered 100 million monthly active users just two months after its launch. DALL-E 2, another OpenAI product, is one of most popular text-to-image generators, capable of producing high-resolution images that have depth-of-field effects with shadows, shading, and reflections.

While heâs not an A.I. researcher or a computer scientists, Altman, 38, sees the tools as a stepping stone on a mission he shares with others in the field: developing a computer superintelligence known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. He believes that âAGI is probably necessary for humanity to survive,â but has suggested heâll be cautious as he works toward it.

Altman's quest for AGI has not blinded him to the risks: he was among the most prominent names to sign the Center for AI safety warning about A.I.'s threat to humanity. At a hearing before U.S. senators in mid-May, Altman called for A.I. regulation, saying rules should be created to incentivize safety âwhile ensuring that people are able to access the technologyâs benefits.â (Some critics speculated that the regulation he called for could also create hurdles to a growing crop of open source competitors to OpenAI).

A former president of startup incubator Y Combinator, Altman is skilled at raising money according to a profile by Fortune's Jeremy Kahn. That knack appears to have paid off big time with OpenAI's $13 billion alliance with Microsoft.

While Musk is no longer affiliated with OpenAI and is reportedly launching a rival A.I. lab, Altman still cites Musk as a mentor who taught him to push the limits on ""hard R&D and hard technology."" He has no plans to follow Musk on mission to Mars however: ""I have no desire to go live on Mars, it sounds horrible. But Iâm happy other people do.â

Margaret Mitchell

Chief ethics scientist, Hugging Face

""People say or think, 'You donât program, you donât know about statistics, you are not as important,' and itâs often not until I start talking about things technically that people take me seriously which is unfortunate. There is a massive cultural barrier in ML."" â source

Margaret Mitchell's interest in A.I. bias began after a couple of troubling instances while working at Microsoft. The data she worked with for the company's Seeing AI assistance technology, for example, expressed odd descriptions of peopleâs race, she recalled in an interview last year. Another time, she fed a system images of an explosion and the output described the wreckage as beautiful.

She realized it wouldnât satisfy her to simply make A.I. systems perform better on benchmarks. âI wanted to fundamentally shift how we were looking at these problems, how we were approaching data and analysis of data, how we were evaluating and all of the factors we were leaving out with these straightforward pipelines,â she said.

That mission has come at a personal cost. Mitchell made headlines in 2021 when Google fired her and Timnit Gebru from their jobs as co-heads of the company's A.I. ethics unit. The pair had published a paper detailing risks of large language models, including the environmental cost and racist and sexist language being funneled into training data. They were also outspoken about insufficient diversity and inclusion efforts at Google and clashed with management over company policies.

Mitchell and Gebru had already achieved significant breakthroughs in the A.I. ethics field, like publishing a paper with multiple other researchers on so-called ""model cards,"" which encourage more transparency on models by providing a way to document performance and identify limitations and biases.

At Hugging Face, an open-source platform provider of machine learning tech she joined after Google, Mitchell has worked intensely on assistive tech and deep learning, and focuses on coding to help build protocols for matters like ethical A.I. research and inclusive hiring.

Despite her background as a researcher and scientist, Mitchell says her focus on ethics leads people to assume she doesnât know how to program. âItâs often not until I start talking about things technically that people take me seriously which is unfortunate,â Mitchell said on a Hugging Face blog last year.

Mustafa Suleyman

Cofounder and CEO, Inflection AI

âUnquestionably, many of the tasks in white-collar land will look very different in the next five to 10 years."" â source Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder and head of artificial intelligence (AI) at DeepMind Technologies Ltd., pauses during Bloomberg's Sooner Than You Think technology conference in Paris, France, on Wednesday, May 23, 2018. Paris is playing host this week to a global gathering of tech executives and entrepreneurs at the Bloomberg conference and at Viva Tech, a three-year-old event for startups, as the French establishment unites behind a push for more tech investment in the city. Photographer: Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Known to friends and colleagues as âMoose,â Suleyman previously worked at Google as VP of AI Products and AI Policy, and co-founded DeepMind, a research lab that was bought by Google in 2014. Since his time at Google, Suleyman has worked for VC firm Greylock and launched a machine learning startup known as Inflection AI.

Earlier this month, Inflection released its first product, a chatbot named Pi for ""personal intelligence."" The current version of the bot can remember conversations with users and offer empathetic responses. Eventually, Suleyman says it will be capable of serving as a personal ""Chief of Staff"" that can book restaurant reservations and handle other daily tasks.

Suleyman, 38, is enthusiastic about what language weâll start using to engage with computers. For Wired, he wrote that weâll someday have âtruly fluent, conversational interactions with all our devices,â which will redefine human-machine interaction.

Suleyman envisions a future where A.I. will cause white collar work to look very different, but also sees potential for it to ââhandle big challenges. On the latter, he thinks the technology can lower the cost of materials for housing and infrastructure and help allocate resources like clean water. Still, heâs a proponent of avoiding harms on the way, writing a warning in the Economist in 2018:

âFrom the spread of facial recognition in drones to biased predictive policing, the risk is that individual and collective rights are left by the wayside in the race for technological advantage.â

Sara Hooker

Director, Cohere For AI

âPart of what I think is going to be really important, especially when you think about things like misinformation or the ability to generate texts that might be used in nefarious ways, is we need better traceability.""  â source

A former researcher at Google Brain, Sara Hooker reunited with her ex-colleagues last year when she joined Cohere, a Toronto startup dedicated to ultra language models and founded by Google Brain alums. It's an arms-length reunion thoughâHooker is heading up a non-profit research lab called Cohere for AI that's funded by Cohere but operates independently.

Cohere for AI describes its mission as ""solving complex machine learning problems."" In practice that means everything from research papers to make LLMs safer and more efficient to the Scholars Program, which seeks to broaden the pool of people involved in A.I. by recruiting talent from all over the world.

One of the criteria to be eligible for the Scholars Program is that a person has not previously published a research paper on machine learning.

âWhen I talk about improving geographic representation, people assume this is a cost we are taking on. They think we are sacrificing progress,â Hooker says. âIt is completely the opposite.â Hooker would know. She grew up in Africa, and helped establish Google's research lab in Ghana.

Hooker also pushes for ML models and algorithms that are accurate and explainable. Speaking to Global News recently, Hooker shared her thoughts on ""model traceability,"" or the ability to trace when a text is generated by a model instead of a human, and how improvements should be made to it. ""Part of what I think is going to be really important, especially when you think about things like misinformation or the ability to generate texts that might be used in nefarious ways, is we need better traceability,"" she said.

And with Cohere having recently raised $270 million in funding from Nvidia, Oracle, and Salesforce Ventures, Hooker's non-profit lab is tied to a startup with some marquee backers.

Rummann Chowdhury

Scientist at Parity Consulting and Responsible AI Fellow, Harvard Universityâs Berkman Klein Center

âThereâs rarely the fundamental question asked: should this thing even exist?â â source

Chowdhuryâs career in A.I. kicked off as a leader for responsible AI at Accenture, where she oversaw design of an algorithmic tool to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems. She left to found an algorithmic auditing company known as Parity AI, and it was later acquired by Twitter. There, she directed the ML Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability team, which was a group of researchers and engineers that worked to mitigate algorithmic harms on the social platform, something she says became challenging after Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk.

She played a leading role among a group of top A.I. developers who got support from the White House to put on a generative A.I. ""red teaming"" event that aims to improve security by evaluating models from Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and others for quirks and limitations during the DEF CON 31 cybersecurity conference in August.

As another A.I. expert on the regulation train, Chowdhury, 43, wrote in Wired recently that there ought to be a generative A.I. global governance body. She pointed to Facebookâs Oversight Board, which is an interdisciplinary global group focused on accountability, as an example of what the body could look like.

âAn organization like this should be a consolidated ongoing effort with expert advisory and collaborations, like the IAEA, rather than a secondary project for people with other full-time jobs,â Chowdhury wrote. âLike the Facebook Oversight Board, it should receive advisory input and guidance from industry, but have the capacity to make independent binding decisions that companies must comply with.â

Sheâs also pushed for what she calls integrated bias assessments and audits in the product development process, which would allow an inspection of something thatâs already been built but also having mechanisms in place from the early stages to decide whether something should make it past the idea phase.

âThereâs rarely the fundamental question asked: should this thing even exist?â she said during a panel discussion on responsible A.I.

CristÃ³bal Valenzuela

Cofounder and CEO, Runway ML

""The history of generative art is not new. The idea of involving an autonomous system in the art-making process has been around for decades outside of the recent AI boom. What's different is that now we are entering a synthetic age."" â source

Valenzuela got into A.I. after learning about neural networks through the work of artist and programmer Gene Kogan. He became so fascinated that he left his home in Chile to become a researcher at NYU Tischâs Interactive Telecommunications Program.

It was there that the idea for Runway came to him as he worked to make machine learning models accessible to artists.Â âI started brainstorming ideas around that and then I realized that ""a platform for models"" already has a name: a runway,â he told cloud computing company Paperspace.

While many artists have embraced A.I., using tools like Runwayâs for visual effects in movies or creating photographs, the 33-year old Valenzuela wants even more artists to embrace A.I.

So, the company helped develop text-to-image model Stable Diffusion. It also made solo feats with its A.I. video editing model, Gen-1 that could improve existing video fed by users. Gen-2 followed this spring, providing users the chance to generate videos from text. Given that entertainers like Weezer have taken advantage of its models by having it make a tour promo video for the rock band and another artist made a short film using the latter model, tools like Runwayâs have gotten buzz for their potential to change how Hollywood approaches filmmaking.

In a talk with MIT, he said the company is working on helping artists find the use cases for their work and reassure them that their jobs wonât be taken. He also argues that in many cases, weâre already using A.I. for artwork even if we donât realize since a photo taken on an iPhone can involve multiple neural networks to optimize an image.

âItâs just another technology that will help you do things in a better way and express you better,â he said.

Demis Hassabis

CEO, Google DeepMind

""At DeepMind, we're quite different from other teams in that we're pretty focused around this one moonshot goal of AGI. We're organized around a long-term roadmap, which is our neuroscience based thesis, which talks about what intelligence is and what's required to get there."" â source

With a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from the University College London, Hassabis made waves by cofounding neural networking startup DeepMind more than a decade ago. The company, which was acquired by Google in 2014, aims to build powerful computer networks that mimic the way the human brain works. In April, Hassabis took command of Google's overall A.I. efforts, after a reorg that merged the internet giant's various A.I. teams.

Hassabis says he got into programming through his love of chess. The former child chess prodigy even bought his first computer from the winnings of chess tournaments. Now, he uses the problem solving and planning required from the game plus his neuroscience background in his work on A.I., which he believes is going to be âthe most beneficial thing to humanity ever.â

He thinks AGI could happen within a decade, and describes DeepMind as neuroscience-inspired A.I. and one of the best ways to address complex questions about the brain. âWe could start shedding light on some of the profound mysteries of the mind like the nature of consciousness, creativity, and dreaming,â he told Ford. And when it comes to whether machine consciousness is possible, he says heâs open minded about that, but thinks âit could well turn out that thereâs something special about biological systemsâ that machines couldnât match.

In 2016, DeepMind's A.I. system AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the world's top human player at the strategy game Go, in which players place stones on a 19 by 19 grid, in a best-of-five match viewed by more than 200 million online. Sedol's defeat to the system was especially shocking since experts said such an outcome wasn't expected for another decade.

Moments like that have made DeepMind the leading face of AGI. But itâs not all games. DeepMind is behind AlphaFold 2, an A.I. system has predicted the 3-D structures of almost every known protein. DeepMind has made these predictions available in a public database. Itâs a discovery that could accelerate drug development and that earned Hassabis and senior staff research scientist John Jumper a $3 million Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences award. Hassabis also co-founded and runs a new Alphabet-owned company, Isomorphic Labs, dedicated to using A.I. to help in drug discovery.

870,2023-04-27T15:20:32+00:00,Google launches AI-powered advertiser features in push for automation,"By Sheila Dang

(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google said on Wednesday it is launching two new artificial intelligence-powered features for advertisers that will automatically find the best ad placements for brands across the tech company's services.

AI has dominated the tech industry in recent months as Google and other companies have developed novel chatbots that can respond to users in open-ended conversations. AI is also being increasingly deployed to serve advertisers, who contribute to the companies' revenue.

While Google has previously introduced AI tools for advertisers, it is now using the technology to help brands achieve more specific goals for their ads.

One of the new features called Demand Gen will use AI to place an advertiser's photo and video ads across several products such as Gmail, the YouTube feed and Shorts, which is YouTube's competitor to popular short-form video app TikTok.

AI will remove the need for advertisers to think about where they should place their ads, and the technology will focus on finding placements that are ""shiny, visual and immersive,"" said Vidhya Srinivasan, Google vice president and general manager of advertising.

The second new feature will use AI to find the best ad placements with the goal of maximizing views of a brand's video ads, Google said.

Early testing shows that brands received on average 40% more video views with the new tool, Srinivasan said.

By using AI to remove some of the ""grunt work"" for advertisers, brands will be able to focus more on their marketing strategy and storytelling, she added.

BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google was charged by EU antitrust regulators with anti-competitive practices in its digital advertising business on Wednesday and may have to sell part of this business to address their concerns.

The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections, two years after it opened an investigation into the case.

""The Commission takes issue with Google favouring its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.

It said Google has since 2014 abused its dominance by favouring its own ad exchange AdX in the ad selection auction by its dominant publisher ad server DFP and also by favouring its ad exchange AdX in the way its ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360 place bids on ad exchanges.

The EU competition watchdog said a behavioural remedy is unlikely to be effective to stop the anti-competitive practices.

""The Commission's preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns,"" it said.

Google is the most dominant digital advertising platform in the world with a 28% market share of global ad revenue, according to research firm Insider Intelligence.

Its 2022 advertising revenues, which include those from its search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube adverts, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $224.5 billion, accounting for 79% of its total revenues.

Google had sought to settle the case three months after the EU watchdog opened its investigation but regulators subsequently grew frustrated with the slow pace and the lack of substantial concessions, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google was charged by EU antitrust regulators with anti-competitive practices in its digital advertising business on Wednesday, which it may now have to sell part of to address their concerns.

The stakes are higher for Google in this latest clash with regulators as it concerns the company's biggest money maker, with the adtech business accounting for 79% of total revenue last year.

The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections, two years after opening an investigation.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Google may have to sell part of its adtech business because a behavioural remedy is unlikely to be effective at stopping the anti-competitive practices.

""Of course I know this is a strong statement but it is a reflection of the nature of the markets, how they function and also why a behavioural commitment seemed to be out of the question,"" she told a news conference.

She said the EU had closely cooperated with competition authorities in the United States and the UK.

879,2023-04-27T11:21:00+00:00,EU say Google must break up its ad-tech business to fix competition concerns,"BRUSSELS (AP) â European Union antitrust regulators took aim at Google's lucrative digital advertising business in an unprecedented decision, saying Wednesday that the tech giant must sell off some of its ad business to address competition concerns.

The European Commission, the bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, said its preliminary view after an investigation is that âonly the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its servicesâ would satisfy the concerns.

The 27-nation EU has led the global movement to crack down on Big Tech companies â including groundbreaking rules on artificial intelligence â but it has previously relied on issuing blockbuster fines, including three antitrust penalties for Google worth billions of euros (dollars).

It's the first time the bloc has told a tech giant that it must split up key parts of its business over violations of the EU's strict antitrust laws, though details on what that would look like have not been released.

Google can now defend itself by making its case before the commission issues its final decision. The company said it disagreed with the finding and âwill respond accordingly,â with the EUâs investigation focusing on a narrow part of its ad business.

âOur advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers,"" said Dan Taylor, Google vice president of global ads. ""Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector.""

The commission's decision stems from a formal investigation that it opened in June 2021, looking into whether Google violated the blocâs competition rules by favoring its own online display advertising technology services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers and advertising technology services.

European Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager says Google is dominant on both sides of the ad-selling market. Google abused that position by favoring its own ad exchange, reinforcing its ability to charge a high fee for its services, the commission said.

âGoogle is representing the interests of both buyers and sellers. And at the same time, Google is setting the rules on how demand and supply should meet,â she said at a news conference."" This gives rise to inherent and pervasive conflicts of interest.â

YouTube was one focus of the commission's investigation, which looked into whether Google was using the video sharing siteâs dominant position to favor its own ad-buying services by imposing restrictions on rivals.

Google's ad tech business is also under investigation by Britain's antitrust watchdog and faces litigation in the U.S.

Brussels has previously hit Google with more than 8 billion euros (now $8.6 billion) worth of fines in three separate antitrust cases, involving its Android mobile operating system and shopping and search advertising services.

The company is appealing all three penalties. An EU court last year slightly reduced the Android penalty to 4.125 million euros. EU regulators have the power to impose penalties worth up to 10% of a companyâs annual revenue."

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google was charged by EU antitrust regulators with anti-competitive practices in its digital advertising business on Wednesday, which it may now have to sell part of to address their concerns.

The stakes are higher for Google in this latest clash with regulators as it concerns the company's biggest money maker, with the adtech business accounting for 79% of total revenue last year.

Its 2022 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube adverts, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $224.5 billion.

The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections, two years after opening an investigation.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Google may have to sell part of its adtech business because a behavioural remedy is unlikely to be effective at stopping the anti-competitive practices.

""Of course I know this is a strong statement but it is a reflection of the nature of the markets, how they function and also why a behavioural commitment seemed to be out of the question,"" she told a news conference.

She said the EU had closely cooperated with competition authorities in the United States and the UK.

The Commission said it took issue with Google favouring its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers.

It said Google has abused its dominance since 2014 by favouring its own ad exchange AdX in the ad selection auction by its dominant publisher ad server DFP, and also by favouring AdX in the way its ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360 place bids on ad exchanges.

Google is the world's dominant digital advertising platform with a 28% market share of global ad revenue, according to research firm Insider Intelligence.

Google had sought to settle the case three months after the investigation was opened but regulators grew frustrated with the slow pace and the lack of substantial concessions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters previously.

886,2023-04-27T07:37:16+00:00,Brussels seeks to break up Google over âillegalâ online ad practices,"European Commission vice-president in charge Europe fit for the digital Margrethe Vestager gives a press conference on the launch of antitrust probe against Google - JOHN THYS/AFP via Getty Images

The European Union is seeking to break up Googleâs giant advertising business in an escalation of Brusselsâ war with the internet giant.

Margrethe Vestager, the EUâs competition chief, announced a âstatement of objectionsâ against Google on Wednesday morning, saying it had used illegal tactics to dominate the online ad market and charged advertisers inflated prices.

The EU said it expected to order Google to sell parts of its advertising business, claiming that this was the only way to ensure the company would change its ways.

Ms Vestager has repeatedly fined the company in recent years, with three separate penalties amounting to more than â¬8bn (Â£6.8bn).

However, this case is the first time that Ms Vestager has said that the EU expects to break up Google. She said it was a âreflection of how pervasive Google is in this value chain that we think divestiture is the only way to solve thisâ.

Google said it would resist attempts to break it up and that it strongly disagreed with the case.

The EUâs objections focus on Googleâs display advertising business, which is used by millions of websites and advertisers to host adverts.

Google runs the worldâs biggest advertising exchange, AdX, which is used to handle the light-speed auctions that determine what adverts are shown on third-party websites.

However, the company also has the most popular automated tools for both buying and managing advertising space.

Ms Vestager said Googleâs tools favoured its own exchange over rivals, for example by sharing information about the best âbidsâ from other exchanges. This gave Googleâs AdX an unfair advantage, allowing it to charge higher fees. â[Google] is setting the rules on how supply and demand should meet,â she said.

Ms Vestager said she had been in âregular contactâ with both the US Department of Justice and Britainâs Competition and Markets Authority in developing the case.

Dan Taylor, Googleâs vice president of global ads, said: âOur advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers.

âGoogle remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The Commissionâs investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the ECâs view and we will respond accordingly.â

A spokesman added that the company would oppose demands to sell any parts of its business and that it would harm advertisers.

A statement of objections is a preliminary set of charges, and it can take years for the European Commission to issue a fine and any order, which can then be appealed by the company."
887,2023-04-27T06:01:56+00:00,Google may be forced to sell off some of its most prized businesses after being hit with fresh EU antitrust charges over alleged adtech abuses,"The European Commission has hit Alphabetâs Google with antitrust charges over its behavior in the advertising technology business, which is the companyâs biggest earner.

The Commission, which has been probing the matter for the last two years, will now launch a formal antitrust investigation. If that confirms its suspicions, it said it may order Google to break up its adtech business.

Google has a major presence in every major part of the adtech value chainâits ad-buying tools and publisher ad server (used to manage advertising space on sites and in apps) are dominant in their fields, and Googleâs AdX is the biggest ad exchange out there.

The Commission said the U.S. giant has for nearly a decade been using its DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) ad server and its Google Ads and DV 360 ad-buying tools to unlawfully favor AdX.

âNot only did this possibly harm Googleâs competitors [in the ad-exchange space] but also publishersâ interests, while also increasing advertisersâ costs. If confirmed, Googleâs practices would be illegal under our competition rules,â said EU antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager.

âGoogle remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector,â said Googleâs vice president for global ads, Dan Taylor, in a statement. âThe Commissionâs investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the ECâs view, and we will respond accordingly.â

In one practice highlighted by the Commission, Googleâs DFP ad server organized sealed-bid auctions for ads, but gave Googleâs AdX a heads-up about rival exchangesâ bids before AdX placed its own bid.

âThe second example is about a practice by Google Ads, Google's buy-side tool for advertisers,â said Vestager. âGoogle Ads places bids on behalf of advertisers so that their ads could be placed on the internet and get good visibility. One would expect Google Ads to place bids on as many ad exchanges as possible, because this would maximize the probability that the ad will be widely displayed.

âOur investigation showed that Google decided to place Google Ads bids only, or almost only, on Googleâs AdX. By doing so, Google managed to make AdX the most attractive marketplace. This gave it a significant competitive advantage over rival ad exchanges.â

Google has received three major antitrust fines from the Commission in recent years: a â¬1.5 billion fine in 2019 for abusing its search monopoly in AdSense for Search boxes on websites; a â¬5 billion fine in 2018 for various Android-related abuses; and a â¬2.7 billion fine in 2017 for unfairly promoting its own comparison-shopping services at the top of its search results.

Apart from paying fines in those cases, the Commission ensured that Google changed its behavior. But in this new case, Vestager is playing a different game.

âThe detection of these behaviors canâ¦be very challenging,â she said. âWe have seen this play out concretely: each time a practice was detected by the industry, Google subtly modified its behavior so as to make it more difficult to detect, but with the same objectives, with the same effects. A remedy requiring Google just to change its behavior would allow Google to continue doing what it has been doing so far, just under a different disguise.â

Therefore, she said the Commission could force Google to jettison its DFP and AdX sell-side tools, thus ending its conflicts of interest.

""We are glad that the Commission is willing to use its competition enforcement toolbox to its full extent, to stop dominant companies like Google abusing their market power as weâve consistently called for,"" said Monique Goyens, director of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC).

Vestager added that she had been coordinating with the U.S. Department of Justice on this case, as well as the U.K.âs Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and other national antitrust authorities. The DOJ, along with several state attorneys general, levied similar charges against Google in January.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) look very promising so lets take a look.

Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alphabet:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) Ã· (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.24 = US$72b Ã· (US$369b - US$69b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).

Therefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 24%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.3% earned by companies in a similar industry.

View our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce

Above you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Alphabet.

The Trend Of ROCE

Alphabet is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 24%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 66% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Alphabet thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.

What We Can Learn From Alphabet's ROCE

To sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 110% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.

Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation  that compares the share price and estimated value.

That message came Wednesday when European regulators officially notified Google that the European Commission had reached a preliminary determination that the company's activity in the ad tech business breached EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in the market.

""Only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns,"" the European Commission said in a statement explaining its decision, while noting that its preliminary determination does not prejudge the outcome of its investigation.

A Google spokeswoman said the company will oppose demands to exit or divest its online ad business.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)

The potential EU action adds to Alphabet's legal troubles. In the US, antitrust authorities and US states have filed antitrust lawsuits against the company.

In January, the US Justice Department and eight US states brought an action saying Google unlawfully leveraged its monopoly in the $278.6 billion online advertising market to block competitors from entering. Nine additional states have since joined in the litigation.

The Justice Department also alleges in a separate suit filed against Google in 2021 that the company is operating an illegal monopoly in the online search business.

In its dispute over Googleâs advertising business, the DOJ is asking the court to order Google's divestment of certain ad tech entities, specifically its Ad Manager suite, which would include its publisher ad server DFT, also known as DoubleClick or GAM, and its ad exchange AdX.

The various legal challenges represent a danger to a big portion of Alphabet's business. In 2022, ad sales drove approximately 80% of approximately $224.5 billion in revenue. Googleâs online advertising business controls most of the technology in the markets to buy, sell, and serve advertisements online.

'A competitive advantage'

The core of the European Commission's initial finding is that Google abuses its dominance in the European Economic Area-wide markets by leveraging its publisher ad servers and programmatic ad buying tools for the open web.

The Commission said Google favors its own ad exchange, AdX, in ad selection auctions run by Google's ad server, DFP. The regulator said DFP informs AdX in advance of the value of the best bid from competitors.

In addition, according to the Commission, Google Ads was avoiding competing ad exchanges and placing most bids on AdX, and in turn, making AdX the most attractive ad exchange.

""The Commission is concerned that Google's allegedly intentional conducts aimed at giving AdX a competitive advantage and may have foreclosed rival ad exchanges. This would have reinforced Google's AdX central role in the ad tech supply chain and Google's ability to charge a high fee for its service,"" the agency stated. Diagram from the European Commission explaining its preliminary finding that Google abused its dominant position in internet search services. The Commission said Google favors its own ad exchange, AdX, in ad selection auctions run by Google's ad server, DFP.

In the European Union, Google and other major tech firms must adhere to newly enacted laws that promote competition â The Digital Markets Act, and a companion law, the Digital Services Act. Penalties for violations of the laws can range up to 10% of a company's global revenue.

The new laws seek to enhance competition by prohibiting large tech companies from favoring their own products and services over those from third parties, and also require enhanced transparency.

Even before the EU's latest laws took effect, the European Commission assessed significant antitrust fines against Google. About a decade ago the regulator imposed a $10 billion penalty for blocking search engines from its Android phones.

Years later in 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Commission targeted Google for allegedly abusing its market dominance in online search, mobile device apps, and online advertising, respectively.

In 2019, the Commission fined Google 1.5 billion Euros for adding restrictive clauses in its contracts with third-parties. The Commission said the terms blocked rivals from placing search adverts on certain websites.

Tech under pressure

Regulators in the US have looked into Google before. In 2013, the FTC declined to take action against Google after an agency investigation into its search business.

The decision followed a $22.5 million fine imposed on the company the prior year to settle claims that it violated a privacy settlement with the FTC agreeing that it would avoid placing âcookiesâ on and serving targeted advertisements to users of Appleâs competing browser, Safari.

Alphabet isn't the only big tech company under new pressure from regulators. The Federal Trade Commission succeeded in obtaining a temporary restraint order from a federal district court in California this week that, for now, squashes Microsoftâs (MSFT) planned acquisition of âCall of Dutyâ maker Activision Blizzard (ATVI).

The court also plans to rule on a preliminary injunction that could further pause the deal while the FTC conducts an agency review of antitrust concerns.

That review that could prevent the Xbox maker from acquiring Activision Blizzard, which the FTC said in its initial complaint may ""enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.""

âHmm, I donât know that one,â it answers.

But ask about any of the other tech giantsâ business practices, and itâs ready to critique them. Surfacing answers from across the internet, Alexa describes Apple Inc. as an âoligopolyâ and cites Alphabet Inc.âs Google as violating privacy rights, according to Bloomberg News tests of the software on three devices.

Lawmakers and regulators have accused Amazon of using its commanding lead in the business of online retail to harm rivals and partners. The company is awaiting the results of a long-running US Federal Trade Commission investigation into its activities. Amazon has courted allies in Washington with tens of millions spent on lobbying and a small army of consultants and public relations professionals.

The company appears to have enlisted its popular Alexa assistant in its effort to protect the companyâs reputation.

âAlexa uses a range of credible organizations and news sources to generate responses on any number of topics, including Amazon,â company spokesperson Kristy Schmidt said in a statement. âWhen we learn of incorrect responses to particular questions, we take a closer look and work to remove responses that are inaccurate or misleading. We do this for a range of topics, as we believe it benefits customers.â

Users probably donât consider digital assistants as primary resources for news and information about antitrust issues, but a Bloomberg test of the devices produced a variety of responses. Alexa, for example, wonât label Amazon a monopoly, but it tends to respond in the affirmative when asked the same question about Google, Meta Platforms Inc.âs Facebook, Microsoft Corp. and Walmart Inc.

When Alexa is asked if Amazon has broken antitrust law, it says, âI donât have an answer to the question I just heard.â Googleâs Assistant and Appleâs Siri, Alexaâs two closest competitors, each cite news stories on government antitrust lawsuits against their companies.

Siri, for the most part, offers up criticisms of the iPhone maker. But it evades at least one question about Appleâs power. When asked whether Apple is a monopoly, Siri often replies, âI canât answer that, but Apple.com should be able to.â

Apple and Google declined to respond to requests for comment.

Alexa also cites alleged privacy lapses by its rivals, bringing up a Facebook privacy settlement with the FTC and allegations that Appleâs finger-scanning technology violates constitutional rights. When users ask whether Amazon violates usersâ privacy, Alexa sticks up for its safeguards: âAmazon builds multiple layers of privacy protections into your Alexa experience.â It also links to an Amazon website with more information about Alexaâs privacy settings.

Earlier this month, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million to settle a complaint brought by the FTC over allegations that Alexa violated laws governing how companies must treat data gathered on children. Amazon denied wrongdoing, and said it disagreed with the FTCâs conclusions.

By default, Alexaâs speech-recognition algorithms aim to put questions into categories based on the userâs intent, and respond with information pulled from vast databases. Requests about the weather, music, or sports scores send the software searching for the answer using pre-programmed logic and data stores.

In response to many informational questions, Alexa tends to lean on data sources like Wikipedia, or, failing that, news stories retrieved from an internet search. The company also crowdsources answers through a program called Alexa Answers. (Asked if Google hurts its competitors, Alexa answered: âAccording to an Alexa Answers contributor: No,â without elaborating.)

This isnât the first instance of Amazon pre-programming responses to controversial questions. In 2017, videos went viral of people asking Alexa whether the assistant worked for the CIA. The software initially declined to respond at all, making a digital ding that evoked a phone call dropping. That didnât quell the curiosity, so Amazon changed the reply to âNo, I work for Amazon.â

Alexa is also sensitive to questions about working conditions at Amazon. In response to a range of queries about Amazon employees â whether they are treated fairly, take rest breaks or paid time off, or have productivity targets â the software replies with the same outdated factoid: âAs of December 2021, Amazon employed 1.608 million people.â

In April, Google proposed to argue the U.S. Justice Department's alleged breach of antitrust law to build and maintainÂ its search dominance.

Alphabet will be allowed to review the concerns raised by the Commission, present a written defense, and request an oral hearing to express their comments.

""The Commission's preliminary assessment suggests that the only effective solution to address the competition concerns is the compulsory divestment of a portion of Google's services,"" stated Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Chief.

Vestager added, ""Google collects users' data, sells advertising space, and operates as an online advertising intermediary. Thus, Google is involved in nearly all ad tech supply chain aspects. Our initial concern is that Google may have exploited its market position to favor its intermediary services. These practices may have harmed not only Google's competitors but also the interests of publishers while simultaneously increasing costs for advertisers. If proven, Google's actions would violate our competition regulations.""

Price Action: GOOG shares are down 0.35% at $123.99 during the premarket session on the last check Wednesday.

897,2023-04-26T19:33:07+00:00,Google Charged by EU With Abusing Its Ad Tech Dominance,"(Bloomberg) -- Google was accused of abusing its dominance over advertising technology to crush competition as the European Union fired off an antitrust charge sheet that threatens a breakup of parts of the lucrative business, kicking off a process that could take years to resolve.

The Alphabet Inc. unit had favored its own ad exchange program over its rivals and bolstered the companyâs central role in the ad tech supply chain as well as Googleâs ability to charge a high fee for its service, Margrethe Vestager, the EUâs competition commissioner, said Wednesday at a press conference.

âThe commissionâs preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns,â Vestager said.

While she said Google may be forced to divest part its ad sales services should the commission decide that the company acted illegally, market reaction to the announcement was muted. European investigations take years to conclude and the previously eye-catching fines that ran into the billions have had little impact on the companyâs share price. The US previously sued Google over the same issue and the UK has an open investigation.

Google shares were little changed in New York after falling as much as 1.9% in market open. The commission will now invite Google to a hearing where it can present its arguments against the blocâs preliminary view.

Crucially, the European Commission said that a potential order for Google to implement behavioral remedies may not be sufficient in correcting the abusive conduct, opening the door for a potential order against Google to break up its ad tech business from its core services.

âGoogle remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector,â Dan Taylor, vice president of global ads at Google, said in a statement. âThe commissionâs investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the ECâs view and we will respond accordingly.â

The EU case is a direct attack on the black-box of online advertising where Google automatically calculates and offers ad space and prices to advertisers and publishers as a user clicks on a web page. Online advertising is Alphabetâs most lucrative business, generating 80% of total revenue last year, adding up to about $225 billion.

The new charge sheet follows three earlier EU cases against Google, in which the company has racked up more than â¬8 billion ($8.6 billion) since 2017 for abuses of dominance on its mobile operating system, its search business, and its display advertising operations. Google has continued to defend its innocence.

So-called statements of objections are a formal step laying out the European Commissionâs concerns over a particular behavior that it deems to be harmful to the market. On Wednesday, the EUâs antitrust arm appealed to Google to come forward with solutions.

While antitrust charge sheets can pave the way for fines as much as 10% of a firmsâ global sales, they seldom approach that level, meaning the impact on earnings of Silicon Valley firms is often muted.

Instead, regulators across Europe have pivoted toward insisting on tough remedies â including changes to the business model of companies â that can be far more onerous. Theyâve also approved a slew of new rules to try to act before itâs too late to stop the most powerful companies turning markets into competition dead-zones.

Google has long held a key position in which itâs able to collect data allowing advertisers to target ads, as well as sell ad space and provide the technology that allows for advertisers to find publishers to sell their space.

The EU first opened a probe into Googleâs ad tech practices in 2021. The commissionâs investigation has been examining how the company may have obstructed rivalsâ access to user-data for online advertising as well as how it may have ringfenced data for its own use.

The UKâs competition authority has also been investigating Googleâs ad tech practices. Litigation against the firmâs behavior is also ongoing in the U.S as part of three different suits filed by the US Department of Justice and a group of states, a separate one from a different group of states and one by advertisers and publishers. Those cases could well result in an order for Google to separate its ad tech arm from its core business.

The European Commission charged Google with violating antitrust law in how it operates its suite of digital advertising technologies.

Google controls both the buy-side and sell-side of the digital advertising market, European Commissioner on Competition Margrethe Vestager wrote on Twitter. She said the government believes that Google used its market control to favor its own platforms and push out competition.

â Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) June 14, 2023

âGoogle is active on both sides of the market with its publisher ad server and with its ad buying tools and holds a dominant position on both ends,â the Commission wrote in a press release. âFurthermore, it operates the largest ad exchange. This leads to a situation of inherent conflicts of interest for Google. The Commissionâs preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns.â

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Europe is following the US in suing Google over ad-tech antitrust violations

The European Commissionâs charge tails a similar lawsuit that the US Department of Justice filed against Google in January. In its complaint, federal prosecutors wrote that Google had illegally bought up competition and manipulated online auctions to self-preference its own services. In its request for relief, the US government asked, among other things, for so-called âstructural reliefââa breakup of Googleâs ad business, including its ad server DFP and its ad exchange AdX.

âGoogleâs anti-competitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Googleâs few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,â the government wrote in its complaint (pdf) at the time.

In the US, Google controls a 28.8% market share in digital advertising, according to the market research firm Insider Intelligence, and is commonly lumped in as one-half of a digital advertising duopoly with Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.

But in recent years, Google and Facebookâs market shares in the US have fallen. Amazon has crept into third place with 11.7% of revenue and relative newcomer TikTok has quickly claimed 2%. Google is still in pole position, of course, but even without regulatory intervention, challengers may be eroding its market power.

This is not Googleâs first rodeo with regulators.

It isnât often that you hear the CEOs of big tech firms singing the praises of government intervention. But as the capabilities of artificial intelligence have built and multiplied, these executives have been calling for greater government involvement in the regulation of AI.

âOpenAI believes that regulation of AI is essential,â said Sam Altman, the companyâs CEO, in written testimony ahead of his meeting with Congress last month. (It is also true, though, that Altman then traveled to Europe and argued against the European Unionâs stricter brand of tech regulation.)  âWith the technology now at an inflection point...I still believe AI is too important not to regulate, and too important not to regulate well,â wrote Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, in an op-ed published in the Financial Times.  â[W]e will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction,â said Satya Nadella, Microsoftâs CEO, on a recent conference call with analysts and investors. âBut quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in AI, I think we stand to gain from that.â

But while Big Tech seems united, AI startups are less enthused about regulation. These smaller companies are either completely against regulation at this moment or want to operate only within a loose set of rules. In part, this is because they face greater uphill battles to survive as small businesses, at a time when the field of AI is in such ferment.

Why do Big Tech CEOs want AI regulation?

The CEOs of Google and Microsoft are taking a proactive approach to regulation in part because they can afford to do, and because theyâve had many run-ins with regulators in the past. Perhaps calling for regulation in advance is a way to preempt another battle, said Alexandre Lebrun, the CEO of Nabla, a Paris-based startup that develops AI-abetted note-taking software for clinical settings.

âI think firstâand, you know, coming from Meta, and probably the same for Googleâthey have been in the crosshairs of regulations for a long time,â said Lebrun, who formerly worked at Meta. âAnd so, asking for regulation, I think itâs like being a good student, showing some goodwill.â And getting on the good side of regulators is always beneficial, Lebrun added, given that government agencies are increasingly being urged to break up Big Tech firms.

Perhaps, too, OpenAIâs embrace of regulation is a way to solidify and protect its own dominant position in the industry. To be sure, many startups use OpenAIâs GPT at the moment. But another large language model may always come along to make GPT irrelevant. Building such a model in an era of high or even moderate regulation will be harder than OpenAIâs challenge of building it when no regulations existed.

The problems with AI regulation

The AI tools from Big Tech stables are already well under development, but a lot of the value of generative AI will come from other companies and users inventing their own applications. Regulation can get in the way of that, said Noam Shazeer, the CEO of Character.AI, a chatbot service that allows people to have open-ended conversations with âpersonalitiesâ and âcharacters.â Some of these personalities may be wholly original; others may mimic fictional characters or real-life individuals like Elon Musk.

Shazeer, who was formerly with Google Brain, said that when his company first launched last year, traffic had started to exponentially grow in China for around three days until the government blocked access to the service. In February, China ordered apps and websites enabling access to ChatGPT to terminate their services. Western regulations are unlikely to be as draconian, but they will still be some form of control, and Shazeer worries that they will stifle innovation. Itâs much too early to know what the best applications are like, he said. âWeâre at the infancy of the technology,â he added. âThe best applications havenât been invented.â

If Big Tech truly yearns for regulation, itâs getting its wish quickly. The EU, which just passed a draft of its AI Act, is at the forefront of creating the first set of AI regulations. The act proposes classifying AI systems by risk. High-risk systems, including AI hiring tools and exam scoring software, would face greater compliance standards, such as data validation and documentation. Generative AI systems, like ChatGPT, must identify that its output has been AI-generated, and provide detailed summaries of the copyrighted data used to train it. In predictive policing and biometric identification, AI systems would be outright banned.

Critics of the AI Act find it too restrictive. âRegulation is necessary, but a very high-level regulation,â said Lebrun. Building AI systems for military use should be prohibited, for instance, he said. âBut I think we should regulate the intent of the model and not how you should build these models,â he said. Such restrictive policies could force ambitious AI startups to move out of the EU, said Lebrun.

Small-molecule drugs can be subject to price negotiations as early as nine years after receiving FDA approval, while biologics have a negotiation timeline of 13 years. Ricks expressed concern that this distinction would significantly limit investment in small-molecule drugs, considered highly efficient in healthcare.

The Alphabet Inc.-owned company announced features Wednesday aimed at helping people understand how apparel will fit on them, no matter their body size, and added capabilities for finding products using its search and image-recognition technology. Additionally, Google introduced new ways to research travel destinations and map routes using generative AI â technology that can craft text, images or even video from simple prompts.

âWe want to make Google the place for consumers to come shop, as well as the place for merchants to connect with consumers,â Maria Renz, Googleâs vice president of commerce, said in an interview ahead of the announcement. âWeâve always been committed to an open ecosystem and a healthy web, and this is one way where weâre bringing this technology to bear across merchants.â

Google is the worldâs dominant search engine, but 46% of respondents in a survey of US shoppers conducted last year said they still started their product searches and research on Amazon, according to the research firm CivicScience. TikTok, too, is making inroads, CivicScienceâs research found â 18% of Gen Z online shoppers turn to the platform first. Google is taking note, with some of its new, AI-powered shopping exploration features aimed at capturing younger audiences.

A new virtual âtry-onâ feature, launching on Wednesday, will let people see how clothes fit across a range of body types, from XXS to 4XL sizes. Apparel will be overlaid on top of images of diverse models that the company photographed while developing the capability.

Google said it was able to launch such a service because of a new image-based AI model that it developed internally, and the company is releasing a new research paper detailing its work alongside the announcement. The depictions of the clothing take into consideration the way fabric stretches and winkles as itâs worn to produce lifelike images. The try-on feature will start with womenâs tops, in partnership with retailers like Anthropologie and Everlane, followed by menâs clothing later.

The company also said it will begin pulling in more sources of information as people test out its new âsearch generative experienceâ â a service that Google first announced at its I/O developers conference last month. For now, that offering is only available through the companyâs experimental Search Labs product.

Google earlier announced that it was using a variety of web-based sources to display AI-generated information on, say, the best hotel for families at a particular vacation destination or the best waterproof Bluetooth speaker. Now itâs also adding in user reviews for its AI model to draw on as well.

The company is rolling out new additions to existing features on Google Maps, too. Immersive view, which uses AI to show people 3D tours of landmarks, is rolling out to four new cities: Amsterdam and Dublin, as well as Florence and Venice in Italy. Google is expanding its collection of landmarks available on immersive view to more than 500 â on both the iOS and Android apps â adding in such destinations as the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Prague Castle.

Glanceable directions, meanwhile, will let people see turn-by-turn directions for walking, cycling and driving modes from their phone lock screens. Google said people will also be able to see updated ETAs as they follow their routes in real time. That feature is rolling out globally in June.

Some AI features on Google Lens â the image-recognition app that uses a phone camera to identify objects and text â have been around for a while, like discovering the name of a local dish by snapping a photo of it while traveling. But on Wednesday, Google said it is launching the ability for users to search for skin conditions using the app.

After a user takes a photo of a rash or a skin bump, Lens will find visual matches for the image that could help inform peopleâs searches, the company said. The feature is meant to be a starting point for research, not certified medical advice, Google said.

The Ministry of Defence has signed a deal with Google to use artificial intelligence (AI) despite recent warnings that the technology could threaten the human race.

The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), the ministryâs research arm, will use Googleâs Cloud platform to learn about AIâs potential uses, which include cybersecurity work, disaster response and speeding up research.

Just last week, Rishi Sunakâs adviser on the technology warned that the world has two years to stop AI from becoming a threat to the human race.

Matt Clifford, the Prime Ministerâs AI task force adviser, said there are âall sorts of risks now and in the futureâ from the âpretty scaryâ technology which should be âvery high on the policy makersâ agendasâ.

But the tech giant and the MoD have promised to use the technology responsibly. Google has also pledged not to allow its AI software to be used for weaponry.

Dstlâs chief executive Paul Hollinshead said: âAs one of the most transformative and ubiquitous new technologies, AI has enormous potential to transform societies.

âDstlâs collaboration with Google Cloud is one of the significant steps Dstl is taking to prioritise research, development, and experimentation of technologies in line with our commitment to safe and responsible AI.â

It comes after thousands of Google staff in 2018 signed a letter protesting their employerâs role in a US programme that used its AI technology to interpret video and refine the accuracy of drone strikes.

It led to the tech company laying down rules for how it deployed AI, including a list of âapplications we will not pursueâ, which included weapons development.

But in the last few years, Google has found some defence work, although the company insists it will not break its own rules.

The companyâs guidelines also ban using AI for surveillance, human rights violations and technology that is âlikely to cause overall harmâ.

Google is integrated generative AI into virtual try-on clothing.

Companies from Walmart to Amazon have jumped into virtual clothing try-on, where shoppers can view how an item would look via simulation. The idea is to be able to see clothing on a model that looks like oneself. But thereâs always a bit of a cut-and-paste look.

Now, Google is betting that it can improve the service with generative AI, which is capable of producing new text and images in response to prompts. On Wednesday (June 14), the company announced a virtual try-on feature that shows you what clothes look like on real models of different shapes and sizes. The simulation looks more realistic than previous try-on technology, as it shows how a clothing item drapes, folds, clings, stretches, and wrinkles, according to Google.

To accomplish this, AI researchers at Google developed a new diffusion model. Diffusion is the process of gradually adding extra pixels, or ânoise,â to an image until it becomes unrecognizable, then removing the noise until the original image is reconstructed. The result is an AI-generated image that looks shockingly realistic. You can see the difference in Walmartâs service (the first image) versus Googleâs (the second image).

Automating fashion photography has been around for some time

Clothing brands turned toward using more AI-generated models during the pandemic when getting access to models in-person was difficult, said Ashwini Asokan, CEO of Vue.ai, an AI retail company that offers a range of automation services including fashion photography.

Thereâs been a growing demand for seeing more diverse models, and companies are respondingâwith varying degrees of success. Leviâs, for instance, said in March it is using AI-generated models as a way to increase the number of diverse models, which led to backlash for the initiativeâs failure to advance real diversity.

Will Google, given its massive reach and generative AI capabilities, be able to fully disrupt the virtual try-on space? Maybe, or maybe notâand in the end, it might not matter for the tech giant. Tech companies have lots of bets that donât pan outâbut they collect a lot of data from these bets, which can be applied to other products in the works, said Asokan. âThese bets are not always meant to scale,â she said, adding that the try-on service is also a way for Google, one of the pioneers of generative AI, to show off its AI muscle.

Google has put thousands of pieces from hundreds of brands including Everlane, H&M, LOFT, and Anthropologie through its AI model. The virtual try-on service is currently only available in the US and is limited to womenâs tops. Which makes sense: As we know, simulating legs in the metaverse is not that easy.

911,2023-04-26T15:45:07+00:00,Oracle Is Fighting For Its Place Under The Cloud Sun,"On Monday after market close, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) delivered a better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter report and revenue guidance for its undergoing quarter. Although it is significantly behind its cloud peers,Â Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the software vendor seems to be on track as it fights for its place under the sun, which in this scenario, is actually, its majesty, the cloud.

Key Fiscal Fourth Quarter Figures

For the quarter ended on May 31st, Oracle generatedÂ $13.84 billionÂ in revenue that grew 17% YoY, topping Refinitivâs expectations ofÂ $13.74 billionÂ and earnedÂ $1.67Â in adjusted earnings per share, also topping Refinitivâs expectation ofÂ $1.58 per share. Net income rose from last yearâs comparable quarter and reached $3.32 billion, or $1.19 per share.

Segmentation

Oracleâs main source of revenue,Â cloud services and license support,Â made a 23% progress toÂ $9.37 billion.Â However, revenue from cloud licenses and on-premises actually dropped 15% as it amounted to $2.15 billion. Revenue from cloud infrastructure expanded 76% and accelerated from 55% growth in the previous quarter, as it amounted to $1.4 billion. Although Oracle is much smaller than its rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, it is growing faster than both Microsoft and Google on this front. CEO Safra Catz stated the unitâs gross margin is expected to continue expanding.

Cloud Is The Star Of The Show

Amid the broader rally in technology stocks, shares of Oracle have outperformed the market and the S&P 500 index. Excluding the after-hours trading, Oracleâs shares roseÂ about 43% year to date, while the S&P 500 index rose only about 13%.Â Over the past year, Oracle has risen more than 50%, far outpacing the 4% rise in the S&P 500 index. Although this performance is a result of several factors, it is largely owed to positive prospects of the companyâs cloud ambitions. Oracleâs primary offering in this segment is called the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and it gives corporations various cloud computing services such as storage and networking, while promising security, reliability and scalability. Although it is lagging behind Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Oracle is doing a good job at positioning itself in a market that is forecasted to grow to $947.3 billion by 2026. All in all, Oracle, known for its database technology, is undergoing a successful business model transformation as it focuses on cloud subscriptions, and the cloud is certainly the right place to be at the moment. During the reported quarter, Oracle revealed that more of its cloud services were approved for use by U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.

Fiscal First Quarter Guidance

With revenue growing in the range between 8% and 10% revenue growth, adjusted earnings are expected in the range between $1.12 and $1.16 per share.

New AI Service

Following Microsoftâs footsteps, the software giant has followed with its own AI bet. Oracle partnered with start-up Cohere to bring in generative artificial intelligence to the cloud service. Cohere has agreed to use Oracleâs cloud infrastructure. Oracle has started to use the tool, Cohere AI cloud service, internally. After confirming the partnership, Oracleâs founder and chief technology officer, Larry Ellison stated that such specialized large language models will be essential to highly trained professionals to make efficient use of their precious time. Still far behind Microsoft, as well as Amazon Web Services who unveiled its Bedrock generative AI services and Google who updated its services and models at the most recent conference, Oracle is certainly goingÂ in the rightÂ direction - towards the cloud.

The Commission preliminarily found that Googleâs advertising technology services have for at least almost a decade broken the European Unionâs antitrust laws because Google âself-preferencesâ these services and tools, essentially freezing out competitors. That gives Google the ability to charge higher advertising fees, and this leads to higher prices for consumers, according to the Commission.

âGoogle is active on both sides of the market with its publisher ad server and with its ad buying tools and holds a dominant position on both ends,â the Commission stated. âFurthermore, it operates the largest ad exchange.â

If the Commission ultimately finds that Google is indeed at fault, the Commission said, âa behavioral remedyâ would be unlikely enough to cure the problem.

âThe Commissionâs preliminary view is therefore that only the mandatory divestment by Google of part of its services would address its competition concerns,â the Commission said.

This is the fourth time the Commission has accused Google of violating European Union antitrust laws, according to The New York Times.

While the Commissionâs preliminary findings didnât single out travel advertisers in particular, they would be affected in a manner similar to advertisers in other industries. That also goes for travelers, who face inflated trip costs because of higher advertising prices.

In response to the Commissionâs statement of objections, Dan Taylor, vice president of Google Ads, said in a prepared statement: âOur advertising technology tools help websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers. Google remains committed to creating value for our publisher and advertiser partners in this highly competitive sector. The Commissionâs investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the ECâs view and we will respond accordingly.â

Bookingâs Pending Acquisition of Etraveli Is In the Crosshairs

The Commissionâs preliminary objections to Booking Holdingsâ acquisition of Sweden-based Etraveli Group are more directly travel-related. That deal has been pending since November 2021 when Booking announced its proposed acquisition of private equity firm CVC Capital Partners-owned Etraveli for around $1.8 billion.

The Commission undertook an in-depth look at this deal in November 2022, and some â but not necessarily all â of its concerns seem a head-scratcher.

The committee found that Booking.com is the dominant online travel agency in the European zone. Thatâs true, but some of the concerns focus on Bookingâs position in hotels.

The Commission stated the acquisition would: âStrengthen Bookingâs dominant position in the hotel OTA market further, increasing its bargaining position towards hotels and diverting demand from cheaper alternative sales channels. Competition is already limited in the hotel OTA market and Booking appears to be unconstrained by competing OTAs, hotels and end customers.â

The âunconstrained by competing OTAsâ mention seems to downplay the role of Google, which operates a robust hotel advertising business in Europe.

Meanwhile, Etraveli indeed operates several online travel agencies such as GoToGate and MyTrip, which offer hotels, as well as flights and rental cars. But these two brands already source their hotels from Booking.com, and they, as well as other brands in the Etraveli Group, focus on flights, not hotels, and the air business is the main reason Booking wants the deal.

Unlike Booking Holdingsâ Priceline brand, which offered flights from day one in 1997, Booking.com only launched flights just before the pandemic, and expanding its flights business is Bookingâs prime motivation behind the deal.

The acquisition would likely only improve Bookingâs hotel business around the edges. And when it comes to any consumer harm, it should be noted that hotels are the ones that set rates â not Booking.com.

Still, the Commission believes that the deal would: âAllow Booking toÂ expand its ecosystem of travel services (e.g., flights, accommodation, car rentals, attractions), making its market position in the hotel OTA market more difficult to contest.â

When considering these two Commission statements of objections against Google and Booking, it appears as though Google has the tougher hill to climb. Still, at this point â although there will be a lot of negotiating to come â it seems like Bookingâs eventual and much-coveted acquisition of ETraveli Group is very much in doubt.

914,2023-04-26T15:19:06+00:00,UPDATE 3-Google faces EU break-up order over anti-competitive adtech practices,"(Adds details on next steps in paragraph 5)

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google may have to sell part of its lucrative adtech business to address concerns about anti-competitive practices, EU regulators said on Wednesday, threatening the company with its harshest regulatory penalty to date.

The European Commission set out its charges in a statement of objections to Google two years after opening an investigation into behaviours such as favouring its own advertising services, which could also lead to a fine of as much as 10% of Google's annual global turnover.

The stakes are higher for Google in this latest clash with regulators as it concerns the company's biggest money maker, with the advertising business accounting for 79% of total revenue last year.

Its 2022 advertising revenue, including from search services, Gmail, Google Play, Google Maps, YouTube adverts, Google Ad Manager, AdMob and AdSense, amounted to $224.5 billion.

Google has a few months to respond to the charge. It can also ask for a closed hearing in front of senior Commission antitrust officials and their national counterparts before the EU issues a decision in a process that could take a year or more. The company also could potentially settle by offering stronger remedies than previously proposed.

EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said Google may have to sell part of its adtech business because a behavioural remedy is unlikely to be effective at stopping the anti-competitive practices.

""For instance, Google could divest its sell-side tools, DFP and AdX. By doing so, we would put an end to the conflicts of interest,"" she told a news conference.

""Of course I know this is a strong statement but it is a reflection of the nature of the markets, how they function and also why a behavioural commitment seemed to be out of the question.""

Google said it disagreed with the Commission's charge.

""The Commission's investigation focuses on a narrow aspect of our advertising business and is not new. We disagree with the EC's view,"" Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement.

Vestager said investigations would continue into Google's introduction of a privacy sandbox set of tools to block third party cookies on its Chrome browser and its plan to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android smartphones.

She said the EU had closely cooperated with competition authorities in the United States and the UK.

The European Publishers Council, which filed a complaint to the Commission last year, welcomed the charge.

The Commission said Google favours its own online display advertising technology services to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers.

It said Google has abused its dominance since 2014 by favouring its own ad exchange AdX in the ad selection auction by its dominant publisher ad server DFP, and also by favouring AdX in the way its ad buying tools Google Ads and DV360 place bids on ad exchanges.

Google is the world's dominant digital advertising platform with a 28% market share of global ad revenue, according to research firm Insider Intelligence.

Google had sought to settle the case three months after the investigation was opened but regulators grew frustrated with the slow pace and the lack of substantial concessions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters previously.

915,2023-04-26T15:15:03+00:00,Google CEO Sundar Pichai: Weâre in a better position to crush it with A.I. than we were in mobile,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a one-word message for those who think the internet giant has fallen behind in the A.I. arms race: mobile.

With its Android smartphone platform, and a massive mobile advertising business, Google famously transformed itself from a desktop-centered company into a dominant force in the mobile computing business a decade ago.

According to Pichai, the company is poised to repeat the featâand perhaps even best itâwith A.I.

âItâs a competitive moment, but Iâve built the company to be A.I. native for a long time,â Pichai said this week in an interview with Bloomberg. âI feel better positioned for this than we were for the shift to mobile.â

That confidence is sure to raise eyebrows among some industry observers who watched the company bungle a rushed launch of its A.I.-based Bard chatbot earlier this year and who have seen startup OpenAI (along with its partner and investor Microsoft) become the stars of the generative A.I. frenzy. And Google suffered another setback just this week when it was forced to delay launching Bard in Europe because of privacy concerns by regulators, according to Politico.

But Pichai is correct in pointing out that Google has been investing in A.I. for years. And itâs also true that Google has shown an impressive ability to adapt to shifting tech currents, as it did in spectacular fashion when the mobile wave threatened to sweep it aside.

After Apple released the iPhone in 2007, Google, along with the rest of the tech industry, scrambled to reposition itself in a new mobile and touch-screen-based world. One year later, Google released Android, a copycat smartphone operating system available free of charge to mobile-phone makers desperate for a way to compete with the iPhone. Within a few years, Android had become the number one smartphone OS in the world.

Of course, Pichai was not Googleâs CEO in 2008. The company was then led by Eric Schmidt, with cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin backing him up in a sort of power trio formation.Â (Appleâs Steve Jobs was so infuriated by Android that he famously vowed to go âthermonuclearâ on Google).

Pichaiâs response to the A.I. threat, by contrast, seems unlikely to get anyone to scramble the jetsâhe told Bloomberg that Google is taking its time and moving cautiously as it incorporates A.I. into its products because of the technologyâs power and its tendency to make mistakes.

âThere are a few things we want to make sure we get right. People come to us and type queries like, âWhatâs the Tylenol dosage for my 3-year-old?â Thereâs no room to get that wrong.â

Google Bard, the A.I.-enhanced search tool the company launched to compete with Microsoftâs A.I.-powered Bing search, is still an experimental project on a test websiteâitâs âvery early time,â Pichai said in the interview, noting that Bing and Bard each have areas where one performs better than the other.

[continue reading below the video]

Unlike the mobile battle that Googleâs past leaders waged against Apple, Pichai is in some ways trying to win the A.I. contest with one hand tied behind his back. The situation was apparent during Googleâs developer conference in May. As Fortuneâs Jeremy Kahn wrote after the event, the dozens of new A.I. features and tools that Google announced were impressive but somewhat incremental: âA lot of it merely ensures Google keeps pace with what Microsoft and an increasing slew of other competitors are offering.â

The announcements and Pichaiâs latest comments seem designed to signal that, far from going into a code-red panic over Microsoftâs A.I. advances, Google sees the competition as a chess match.

And Pichai certainly isnât about to âdance,â as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a taunt during the companyâs A.I. launch event in February.

âI think he said it so that you would ask me this question,â Pichai noted when asked about the comment by Bloomberg. âItâs all part of the game.â

The most recent development is Google Cloud's announcement that Mayo Clinic is using a new service â Enterprise Search on Generative AI App Builder â that allows users to employ Google's technology to create chatbots to quickly and efficiently review massive amounts of internal data.

What Does This Mean In The Healthcare Space?

In the context of healthcare, this translates to healthcare professionals being able to rapidly interpret data such as a patientâs health history, imaging records, genomics or lab results via a simple query, irrespective of the dataâs format or storage location.

Mayo Clinic is among the first to adopt this technology, which Google sees as a step toward enhancing the use of generative AI across healthcare.

""Mayo Clinic is a world leader in leveraging AI for good, and they are a critical partner as we identify responsible ways to bring this transformative technology to healthcare,"" said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian.

Generative AI has been a dominant theme in technology circles since the end of 2022, when OpenAI, backed by Microsoft Corp., made the chatbot ChatGPT publicly accessible.

Google quickly responded by launching its own AI chat service Bard earlier this year and is making concerted efforts to integrate the foundational technology into as many products as feasible. The healthcare industry poses a unique challenge, as the scope for errors or âhallucinationsâ â situations where AI models entirely fabricate information â is minimal.

The search giant has assured that its privacy approach allows customers to maintain control over their data and has emphasized that the new service complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Google Cloud and Mayo Clinic formalized a decade-long partnership in 2019. At that time, Mayo Clinic recognized Google Cloud as the foundation of its digital transition. The recently announced partnership marks the commencement of an expanded alliance between the two entities centered on the development of AI applications in healthcare.

918,2023-04-26T14:19:00+00:00,A popular Google search hack doesnât work because of the Reddit protests,"A popular search hack of adding âRedditâ to the end of a Google query isnât working because of the ongoing Reddit digital protest. Some users are saying itâs making Google less effective.

Redditors are protesting Redditâs decision to charge for access to its APIâthe connective technology that allows other sites and services to access the conversations that take place on the website. The API was previously free to access, and some third-party Reddit apps, like Apollo, say they canât afford to pay for access.

In protest of the new policy, more than 8,000 subreddits went âdarkâ or private on June 12. Some are saying they may stay that way indefinitely, though Reddit CEO Steve Huffman has reportedly said that he believes the protests will eventually peter out like other âblowupsâ on Reddit.

A side-effect of the protests is that Google users are being deprived of the conversational feedback and wide-scoping perspectives that the discussions in Reddit forums provide. Many people specifically seek those perspectives when they do an internet search by including the word Reddit in quotes at the end of a search queryâas one commenter on Twitter put it a couple of years ago, itâs âthe best life hack I could ever impart for getting results from real people rather than affiliate sites.â

But with the subreddits now shuttered in protest, most of the Reddit links suggested by Googleâs search engine will be unreadable, taking users instead to a private, unreadable Reddit page. That means, for example, thereâs no more quick fix for finding oneâs favorite meme on r/Funny, which has over 40 million followers; or to find corroborated home repair advice on r/DIY, which has over 20 million followers.

âThe Reddit blackout is making it hard to find anything on Google. I didn't realize how much I used Reddit for information until so many of its servers got locked down. Is anyone else finding the blackout difficult?â wrote one user on Reddit Tuesday.

The situation is a real time example of the unexpected ripple effects that can occur in the digital economy.

âI'm not an active Redditor at all but my entire search history is ""[topic] reddit"" because that's the only viable query for tools, tech, home repair, etc etc,â writes another user on Twitter Monday. 
The subreddits that have gone dark can be found on Twitch.

(Bloomberg) -- Since the Kakhovka dam burst on June 6, the floods have cut off any chance Ukraineâs troops might have had of crossing the Dnipro River in support of their counteroffensive. Yet that benefit to the Kremlin may not last.

Below the dam, floodwaters already have begun to recede and eventually will return the river to its former state, if with new obstacles such as washed up land mines and debris. Upstream, as the 230-kilometer (140-mile) long Kakhovka reservoir basin empties, an entirely new landscape is emerging that could potentially create opportunities for Ukrainian forces.

Already, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War is redrawing its battlefield maps to reflect the sudden shrinkage of the water course that separates Ukrainian forces from the occupied land on the eastern banks of the reservoir.

The dam was destroyed just as Ukrainian forces began a counteroffensive, months in the planning, that seeks to recapture territory lost to Russia in the south and east of the country following last yearâs invasion.

As Kyiv deploys billions of dollars of western weaponry along a front stretching for 1,000 miles, the Dnipro is a crucial feature of the battlefield, offering protection to troops facing each other across much of its southern portion and posing a major logistical challenge to Ukrainian strategists working out how to keep their forces supplied as they advance.

The eventual extent of that barrier will depend on how severely the dam has been damaged, as well as on the silt that has collected on the reservoirâs floor since the damâs construction in 1956.

âThe key question here is the height of the dam that remained underwater after the destruction,â said Illya Perevozchykov, who heads the hydrology department of Ukraineâs national meteorological service said in a phone interview. âThis height defines the amount of water that is going to stay.â

The Dnipro has been central to Ukraineâs identity and economy for centuries. Soviet engineers turned the river into a cascade of six huge reservoirs, each with a hydroelectric dam to produce power for the industrial heartland on its banks. Kakhovka was the last before the river empties into the Black Sea, forming a huge natural barrier between the opposing armies.

But by Sunday, the reservoirâs water level had dropped by about half, releasing 73% of its volume, Ukrhydroenergo director Ihor Syrota said in a Youtube interview with Radio Liberty. Newly exposed silt banks make it impossible for agency staff to move now stranded monitoring stations close enough to measure the reduced levels directly, he said.

On Wednesday, Syrota said reservoir levels are expected to continue falling, and floodwaters to recede for another week.

The surface under the water is made up of silt and itâs hard to say how fast that will then dry, according to Perevozchykov. Predicting what, if anything, that will in turn mean for the opposing militaries is even harder, given that the terrain and its condition will be completely new.

Russia has occupied the damaged area of the dam for months, but denies responsibility for causing its collapse. Ukraine and its allies reject that.

But for the moment, the two sides seem to agree on the military impact.

With the flood for now eliminating any threat from across the Dnipro, Russian commanders have redeployed troops from positions along the river to shore up defenses further east, Ukraineâs Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said on June 11.

President Vladimir Putin called the breach âbetter for us,â in unusually frank televised comments on the war Tuesday. He said the damâs destruction had thwarted an alleged Ukrainian plan to attack across the river, while also lamenting Russiaâs low stocks of modern weapons and the loss of 54 tanks to Ukraineâs week-old counteroffensive. He said Ukraine lost 160 tanks in the fight so far, a figure vastly higher than has been independently verified.

Should the reservoir empty completely, a Dnipro reduced to its pre-dam state between Nova Kakhovka and Zaporizhzhia would be a much smaller obstacle to forces seeking to cross it, with an average depth of about 3 meters, instead of 16.5. The span any Ukrainian force would need to cross north of the dam also would shrink sharply, from a maximum of 23 kilometers, to about one.

In its un-dammed state, the Dnipro also often divided into smaller channels as it meandered, according to maps made in 1954, shortly before the Kakhovka damâs construction.

The original riverbed under the reservoir had broad marshes, but also bridges over narrower points, including at Nikopol, a town just across the Dnipro from Europeâs largest nuclear power plant. The facility remains under Russian control.

The Dnipro cuts through Ukraineâs north-south spine and begins at the boggy southern end of Russiaâs Valdai hills, where Putin has one of his presidential retreats.

Dams on the river were blown up twice during World War II as part of defensive operations, although both of those tactics ultimately failed.

In 1941 Soviet dictator Josef Stalin blew the riverâs first dam, which heâd built just nine years earlier near Zaporizhzhia, to slow approaching German armies. The flood killed an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 people, including drowned Soviet troops that werenât warned in time.

The Germans rebuilt the dam under occupation, before blowing it up again in 1943 as they used the Dnipro to stiffen a defensive line against a massive Soviet counteroffensive.

While the military role that the Kakhovka damâs destruction will play this time remains unclear, itâs economic impact is easier to predict. The reservoir fed multiple factories, the nuclear power plant at Enerhodar and Europeâs largest agricultural irrigation system, as well as the canal supplying water to Crimea, the peninsula Putin annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

According to Ukraineâs Ministry of Agriculture, loss of the irrigation network alone would deprive 584,000 hectares of arable land of water, an area that in 2021 produced 4 million tons of grain and oilseeds worth $1.5 billion.

Despite the hits to agriculture and steel production, Dragon Capital, Ukraine's largest investment manager, doesn't think the immediate economic impact of the floods will be big enough to change its growth forecasts, according to Olena Bilan, the company's chief economist.

That's because economy is currently doing better than expected, said Bilan, even though in the longer term the dam's destruction will mean ``additional costs for reconstruction and recovering from damage.''

âThere has been no flood like this in Ukraine, for certain,â said Perevozchykov, the hydrologist. âAnd probably not in all of Europe.â

Kathy Lee, Google Cloud's managing director for Greater China, told the South China Morning Post on Thursday that the company's government relations team is working closely with Hong Kong authorities, and that its cloud computing unit is committed to serving the city.

Lee, who spoke to the Post on the sidelines of an industry summit hosted by Google, is not an official company spokeswoman. The Mountain View, California-based firm said in a press release about the event that it wants to help ""make Hong Kong a smarter digital city"" through its cloud business.

Fears are growing that the world's largest search engine operator may exit Hong Kong, as the city's officials seek a court order to prohibit the online circulation of ""Glory to Hong Kong"", a controversial protest song made popular during anti-government unrest in the city in 2019.

Secretary for Justice Paul Lam Ting-kwok last week applied to Hong Kong's High Court for an injunction to prevent anyone with criminal intent from ""broadcasting, performing, printing, publishing, selling, offering for sale, distributing, disseminating, displaying or reproducing"" the song ""in any way"".

The Hong Kong government's move followed a series of anthem-related mix-ups during overseas sport tournaments, when ""Glory to Hong Kong"" was played instead of the Chinese national anthem ""March of the Volunteers"".

Google refused a request by Hong Kong authorities last year to ensure that the Chinese national anthem appears as the top search result for certain keywords, saying it would not manually manipulate organic web listing. It pledged to continue to engage with the government and explain how its platforms and removal policies worked.

Tech experts have suggested that authorities could further promote the website of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau - which had updated its webpage to allow people to download the correct tune - and add better search keywords to boost its rankings in various geographic regions.

Google pulled its search engine out of mainland China in 2010, citing Beijing's growing censorship of online speech, as well as cyberattacks on the company that it said originated from the country.

But under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Google's global search service remains available in Hong Kong, where Google.com was the most visited website in the city last month, followed by sister site YouTube, according to web analytics firm SimilarWeb.

Google and other multinational technology companies are having an increasingly hard time navigating geopolitical tensions in Hong Kong amid Beijing's tightening grip on the city and worsening US-China relations.

While most of Google's suite of products remain easily accessible in the city, the firm has not made its new artificial intelligence chatbot Bard available to residents in Hong Kong. Local visitors to the site are currently greeted with the message: ""Bard isn't currently supported in your country. Stay tuned!""

Google has not disclosed market-specific plans for its ChatGPT rival, other than saying that it aims to expand Bard to more countries and territories. It said last month that ""Bard is in its early days - and given how new the technology is, we want to roll it out thoughtfully and responsibly"".

Google is making money from those misleading abortion seekers, according to a new study.

Fake abortion clinics have spent a combined $10.2 million on Google search ads over the last two years, a new report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) revealed, citing data from enterprise analytics tool Semrush.

All the sports that are part of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing plan Google has officially changed its mind about remote work How many UBI trials do we need to prove giving away money works?

The search giant show results for âfake reproductive health clinicsâsometimes called Crisis Pregnancy Centersâappear to offer independent advice on reproductive healthcare but are actually run by ideological anti-choice organizations who try to shame those seeking abortions and employ scare tactics based on medical misinformation,â CCDH wrote in its findings released today (June 15).

Deceptive Google ads by the anti-choice movement, by the digits

188: Crisis pregnancy centers that placed ads on Google worth an estimated total of more than $10 million over two years

2,600: The estimated number of so-called Crisis Pregnancy Centers operating across the country, outnumbering genuine clinics by a factor of three to one

4 times: How much more the anti-choice movement spent on Google Search ads for fake clinics than it did on ads for overt campaigns to restrict abortion care

2 times: How much more fake clinics spent in states where abortion is legal compared to states with bans. The top three states for fake clinic ad spend were Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Californiaâeverywhere abortion is currently legal

71%: Share of fake clinic websites advertised on Google Search that use deceptive techniques to target people seeking reproductive care

16%: Share of fake clinic websites that promoted misleading claims about abortion, including âexaggerating the risks to mental health, overstating the risk of complications to future pregnancies such as fertility loss, or claiming that abortion can increase the risk of breast cancer,â according to the CCDH

38%: Share of fake clinic websites that donât carry homepage disclaimers clearly stating that they do not provide abortions

40%: Share of fake clinics that promote so-called abortion pill âreversalâ (APR) to undo a medication abortion after the first of two pills. Itâs unproven and likely unsafe

$2.6 million: How much Google made from ads leading to fake clinic websites promoting APR since promising not to run ads for the procedure in September 2021

15,000: Number of different queries related to abortion, including âabortion clinic near meâ, âabortion pillâ, âabortion clinicâ, and âplanned parenthood,â that fake clinics target with these ads

102 million: Searches for queries related to abortions made by Americans each year

Quotable: Google is enabling the anti-choice movement

âGoogle is selling the digital equivalent of Super Bowl slots to deceptive anti-choice bidders, allowing them to distort reality and limit the choices available to those searching for information and options.â âCCDH CEO Imran Ahmed

Company of interest: Google

Google is the go-to search engine for the vast majority of internet users. US-based internet users tend to bestow the most faith in the Alphabet-owned platform versus other sites like Facebook and TikTok. But people arenât great at telling the difference between an ad and an organic search resultâ68% of users canât tell distinguish between the two.

Thatâs why itâs a problem that Google has been aware of these bad actors for at least a couple of years, but is doing little to stop them.

A year after a September 2021 report by the CCDH, Google didnât keep its promise of labelling these fake abortion clinics clearly. A June 2022 report by the group revealed that in states where anti-abortion laws were âtriggeredâ after Roe v Wade was overturned, one in ten results led to fake clinic websites.

In fact, the spread of misinformation has gotten worseâmore discriminatory, even. And CCDH is not the only one ringing alarm bells. In abortion care search results, Google was likelier to target low-income women versus their wealthier counterparts in ads promoting anti-abortioncrisis pregnancy centers, according to research from the Tech Transparency Project published in February.

Rabbit hole: Cottage industry of anti-choice digital marketing companies

Google has âenabled a cottage industry of anti-choice marketing firms,â the CCDH alleges in its report. Marketing agencies like Choose Life Marketing, RankMonsters, and iRapture, targeting abortion seekers are not only allowed to advertise, but sometimes, their campaigns are even subsidized.

Back in 2019, Google was criticized for giving a group of anti-choice clinics run by a Catholic group tens of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising. The company has since changed its policies to require such organizations to note whether they actually offer abortion services. But the grants are still falling in the wrong hands: At least one anti-choice marketing firm mentioned in the report helps fake clinics access the behemothâs Ad Grant scheme, which offers non-profit organizations up to $10,000 per month in free ad credits.

""There is a lot of talk about technological innovation, AI, machine learning, robotics, automation, cloud computing, and quantum computing, and you name it. But we don't see that in the aggregate productivity number. Productivity growth in the US has been barely 1%, slightly lower. In 10 years, are we going to see a significant increase in productivity? I'm quite optimistic. I'm a productivity optimist and a technology optimist,"" Roubini told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).

This week alone brought two examples of generative AI's potential on economic output.

First, a new McKinsey study identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could unleash $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually.

The same study found that generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 detailed work activities such as communicating with others about operational plans.

""Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employeesâ time today,"" McKinsey's researchers noted.

Meanwhile, software giant Salesforce (CRM) took the wraps off its new GPT"" enterprise products designed to boost worker productivity.

The company introduced ""AI Cloud"" at a New York City investor day. Salesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content for customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.

Salesforce employees also showed off coming AI functions in the workplace collaboration platform Slack. Most of Salesforce's new AI suite will begin rolling out in the coming months.

""We've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry â the cloud, social, mobile â but this AI wave is going be the biggest that anyone has ever seen,"" Salesforce co-founder, chairman, and CEO Marc Benioff told Yahoo Finance Live.

Despite AI's promising positive impact on the economy, Roubini and other experts do warn about the drawbacks.

""I think there are meaningful lags [on AI's impact]. And the idea there will be a surge in economic growth in the next two or three years because of AI and technology to me seems to be sort of farfetched,"" Roubini said. ""In the medium long term, technology is going to be deflationary. But we might be facing a decade of stagflation before we see the bright light of technology and AI increasing growth and reducing inflation.""

Goldman Sachs estimated recently that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million jobs globally to automation over the next decade. That's a nice way of saying a person may lose their job to a robot.

But to Roubini's point, Goldman notes US labor productivity will grow by 1.5% over a 10-year period following the widespread adoption of generative AI. AI could also eventually increase the annual global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 7%.

Growing Generative AI Efforts

The latest move marks Googleâs progress in the generative AI space, into which it forayed at the beginning of this year by unveiling its chatbot called Bard.

Notably, Bard marks Googleâs cutthroat response to ChatGPT, a chatbot from the Microsoft MSFT-backed startup OpenAI, which has taken the world by storm.

Apart from the new try-on clothes feature, the company unveiled new features to do research on travel destinations and map routes using generative AI.

Further, Google Cloud recently launched consulting services, which include advice and tools for helping its clients adopt generative AI techniques.

Moreover, these tools are designed to help customers boost automation in their business operations by generating content and summarizing information with the power of AI.

With its growing generative AI efforts, Google is witnessing growth in its client base. Recently, its generative AI tools were selected by Mayo Clinic and Booking Holdings BKNG.

Booking Holdingsâ Priceline is set to implement Googleâs generative AI capabilities across its customer-facing and internal parts of the business.

Priceline is developing its generative AI-powered travel assistant chatbot by leveraging Google Cloud's Generative AI App Builder. This chatbot, which will begin rolling out this summer, is intended to help customers in multiple aspects of their travel planning and booking journeys via a conversational mode.

Considering these factors, we believe Alphabet remains well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects present in the generative AI market.

Per a Grand View Research report, the market is likely to hit $109.4 billion by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 34.6% between 2022 and 2030.

Growing prospects in this promising market are expected to instill investorsâ optimism in the stock.

Notably, Alphabet has gained 40.2% on a year-to-date basis.

Competitive Scenario

Alphabetâs growing generative AI efforts are likely to stiffen competition for its peers - Microsoft and Amazon AMZN, which are also making concerted efforts toward bolstering their generative AI offerings.

Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Microsoft recently integrated OpenAIâs next-generation LLM â GPT-4 â into its search engine Bing and browser Edge to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience to users.

Further, Microsoft Azure offers Azure OpenAI Service, which enables the seamless application of Large Language Models (LLM) and generative AI techniques in various use cases.

Meanwhile, Amazonâs cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), unveiled an AI-powered solution â Amazon Bedrock to accelerate the deployment of generative AI-backed foundation models (FM). Further, the company introduced its language model called Amazon Titan.

Amazon Bedrock provides seamless access to high-performing FMs from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI, among others, through an API. With these FMs, developers can build and scale their generative AI-based applications.

Further, the e-commerce giant is reportedly looking into infusing generative AI features into the search bar of its app.

931,2023-04-26T10:41:39+00:00,Security firm: Chinese hackers broke into email security appliance in spying campaign,"Suspected state-backed Chinese hackers used a security hole in a popular email security appliance to break into the networks of hundreds of public and private sector organizations globally, nearly a third of them government agencies including foreign ministries, the cybersecurity firm Mandiant said Thursday.

âThis is the broadest cyber espionage campaign known to be conducted by a China-nexus threat actor since the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange in early 2021,â Charles Carmakal, Mandiant's chief technical officer, said in a emailed statement. That hack compromised tens of thousands of computers globally.

In a blog post Thursday, Google-owned Mandiant expressed âhigh confidenceâ that the group exploiting a software vulnerability in Barracuda Networks' Email Security Gateway was engaged in âespionage activity in support of the Peopleâs Republic of China.â It said the activivity began as early as October.

The hackers sent emails containing malicious file attachments to gain access to targeted organizationsâ devices and data, Mandiant said. Of those organizations, 55% were from the Americas, 22% from Asia Pacific and 24% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa and they included foreign ministries in Southeast Asia, foreign trade offices and academic organizations in Taiwan and Hong Kong. the company said.

Mandiant said the majority impact in the Americas may partially reflect the geography of Barracuda's customer base.

Barracuda announced on June 6 that some of its its email security appliances had been hacked as early as October, giving the intruders a back door into compromised networks. The hack was so severe the California company recommended fully replacing the appliances.

After discovering it in mid-May, Barracuda released containment and remediation patches but the hacking group, which Mandiant identifies as UNC4841, altered their malware to try to maintain access, Mandiant said. The group then âcountered with high frequency operations targeting a number of victims located in at least 16 different countries.â

Mandiant said the targeting at both the organizational and individual account levels, focused on issues that are high policy priorities for China, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. It said the hackers searched for email accounts of people working for governments of political or strategic interest to China at the time they were participating in diplomatic meetings with other countries.

In a emailed statement Thursday, Barracuda said about 5% of its active Email Security Gateway appliances worldwide showed evidence of potential compromise. It said it was providing replacement appliances to affected customers at no cost.

The U.S. government has accused Beijing of being its principal cyberespionage threat, with state-backed Chinese hackers stealing data from both the private and public sector.

China says the U.S. also engages in cyberespionage against it, hacking into computers of its universities and companies.

Strengthening AWS offerings, which are constantly driving the company's cloud customer momentum, remains the key catalyst.

The latest partnership of identity verification provider Veriff with AWS is a testament to the same.

On the back of this partnership, the former expands the usage of the AWS cloud platform. Moreover, Veriff is reinforcing its IT infrastructure with AWS in order to stay alert of fraudulent attacks.

Further, it is leveraging the machine learning capabilities of AWS to accelerate the development of new identity verification solutions for various sectors.

More precisely, Veriff is using Amazon EC2 instances with the NVIDIA GPU.

This way, Veriff will be able to boost the training process and deploy its identity verification technology models, which in turn will aid it in countering the threat of fraud attacks.

The latest partnership highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.

Expanding Customer Base

The latest move of Veriff has added strength to the customer base of AWS.

Apart from Veriff, AWS was recently selected by Experian as the preferred cloud provider. With the aid of AWSâs robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure, Experian intends to shift its core business operations, consumer-services products, analytics tools and on-premises servers to AWS in a bid to support its multiyear information technology modernization initiative.

Further, AWS was picked by Southwest Airlines Co. LUV as the preferred cloud provider.

Southwest Airlines strives to boost its digital transformation efforts, deliver a responsive customer support experience, streamline its operations and unveil advanced digital solutions on the heels of AWS solutions.

In addition, Zurich Insurance Group selected AWS to migrate its enterprise information technology infrastructure to AWS.

We believe that AWSâs expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2023, AWS generated revenues of $21.3 billion (17% of total sales), which grew 16% year over year.

Moreover, the strengthening performance of AWS, which has become an integral part of Amazon, will likely instill investor optimism in the stock.

Notably, Amazon has gained 50.5% on a year-to-date basis.

Conclusion

We believe that AWSâs growing global clientele, on the back of its expanding portfolio as well as data centers and cloud regions, will continue to help the company gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabetâs GOOGL Google.

Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Microsoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. The company is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of global availability zones and regions, along with strength in its consumption-based business, is likely to continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.

Similarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.

Nevertheless, AWS, with solid customer momentum, continues to maintain its dominant position in the cloud market.

According to the latest Canalys report, AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in first-quarter 2023, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.

Microsoftâs Azure, the second-largest cloud-service provider, accounted for 23% of worldwide cloud spending. Alphabetâs Google Cloud represented 9% of cloud spending, making it the third-largest cloud provider.

Photo: SEEQC/Handout via Reuters

As the AI Summit kicked off in London on Wednesday, tech industry heavyweights rubbed shoulders with government officials, symbolising what has defined many of the discussions during London Tech Week so far.

Continuing today, the agenda includes an entire stage devoted to the likes of quantum computing, and has so far broadcast talks on hot button issues of regulation, diversity in the industry, as well as how to fundraise in this economic environment, and creating tech for the underserved, with attendees from the likes of Google, Amazon, TikTok, AWS, Fujitsu and numerous government departments.

The AI sector is of growing importance in the UK, already contributing Â£3.7 billion to the UK economy and employing 50,000 people across the country, according to recent figures.

Here's what was on the industry's mind as the UK ramps up its play to become a global tech hub.

Businesses are still looking to use data to hyper-personalise

As governments evaluate their options, businesses are increasingly looking at how they can use data and machine learning to tailor online content even further for consumers.

Speakers from Yelp, Ocado, TikTok and Dataforce outlined the benefits and challenges of using AI to 'improve' customer experience in this way.

Online directory Yelp is looking at how it can build more ""contextual"" search experiences via AI, including images and videos, according to Mohamed Sayed, the company's machine learning engineering manager in content understanding.

Meanwhile, the famously algorithm-driven TikTok has been testing ways to use AI to build immersive experiences in e-commerce, according to Aibek Sarimbekov, director of sales engineering at ByteDance, TikTok's parent company.

Gabriel Straub, chief data officer of Ocado, which sells its stocking and delivery software packages out to other businesses, noted that the more data they have, the more ""aspirational"" the company can make a user's journey.

Regulation and compliance

While companies grapple with customer data, it's no surprise regulation is also on tech leaders' minds this week; it was only yesterday that the EU rubber-stamped its first comprehensive set of guidelines for AI.

The new law proposes that generative AI systems, such as ChatGPT, are reviewed before commercial release, and seeks to ban facial recognition.

This week, Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, also warned against AI being used to help make decisions that can affect people's livelihoods, such as whether they can apply for a mortgage.

Panel talks included those on ""preparing for an era of tighter regulation"" and workshops on navigating regulation including what business leaders can do now to prepare for tighter rules.

In a panel focused on bridging the gap between technical sides of AI in businesses, and design, crypto exchange Coinbase's machine learning product lead Vik Scoggins noted that there is a fine balance between moving fast and being compliant. Adding that it is a ""painful period"" to navigate.

Maybe the era of ""move fast and break things"" in tech is closing out in favour of something more cautious.

Quantum computing is on the horizon

The potential for the mind-blowing capabilities of quantum computing also got a good showing. Fujitsu had live demonstrations and models of quantum chips at its exhibition stand.

As one of the five technology areas the government is looking to push, Hannah Boardman, director at Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, said that the government hopes to Â£1 of private funding for every Â£1 of public funding for the tech. There is also a quantum skills taskforce underway.

It could take some time before quantum computing is adopted in a widespread way by business, as many are still working on understanding how its capabilities can be harnessed.

Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Richard Blumenthal expected the bill to create an AI carve-out toÂ Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for the content posted to their platforms.

Hawley, a Republican, did not wish to repeat the same mistakes with generative AI as with Big Tech in Section 230.

939,2023-04-26T09:52:00+00:00,Rep. Waters calls on House to hold hearing on AI â âimmediatelyâ,"The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), is calling on committee chairman Patrick Henry (R-N.C.) to schedule a hearing on the implications of big tech's foray into artificial intelligence

In a letter Thursday, Waters requested that McHenry ""immediately schedule"" a committee hearing on the implications of ChatGPT, Microsoft Bingâs AI chat, and other AI for the housing and financial services industry.

""The speed at which AI is being developed can potentially outpace Congressâ and regulatorsâ roles in fully assessing and understanding the harms of AI systems and the ability to put in place integral consumer and investor protections,"" Waters wrote. ""The Committee must move quickly to consider the potentially disruptive effects of these powerful AI models.""

Waters says if AIâs growth is not monitored closely, it could inflict large-scale societal and economic harm, including the potential for exposing consumersâ data, creating inaccurate financial assessments, and spreading misinformation, posing risks to financial stability.

Goldman Sachs, for example, has warned that if AI delivers on its promised capabilities, the job market could face significant disruption. The investment bank estimates roughly two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation and that AI could cost 300 million jobs globally. (Though, theoretically, that would be offset with the creation of new jobs.) Take my AI, please! OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last May testifies before a Senate hearing in Washington DC titled 'Oversight of A.I.: Rules for Artificial Intelligence.' (REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz)

Waters spearheaded a task force last congress on financial technologies and AI, which raised ethical and legal concerns about bias and discrimination by algorithms, especially if automated programs donât perform as intended. The task force found AI could embed inequities in financial services and the housing market by using data that reflect underlying bias or discrimination.

Waters's warning comes after Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, an AI research technology company backed by Microsoft (MSFT) that helped create ChatGPT, testified last month before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that government intervention will be necessary to reign in the risks of AI systems.

""I would form a new agency that licenses any effort above a certain scale of capabilities, and can take that license away and ensure compliance with safety standards,"" Altman said. ""No. 2, I would create a set of safety standards...[There should be] specific tests a model has to pass before it can be deployed in the world.""

Altman also said that it will be important to include ""independent audits"" from ""experts who can say that the model is or isn't in compliance with state and safety thresholds.""

Top tech CEOs from tech companies working on AI technology â including Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), which has developed the AI chatbot Bard, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and OpenAIâs Altman â all met with Vice President Kamala Harris and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo last month to discuss the dangers of AI and Washingtonâs role in it.

Much has been made about incorrect answers, fabricated information, and other concerning interactions with Microsoftâs ChatGPT, which caused the company to pull it back initially after its launch in February before putting it up again. A new report from the Wall Street Journal this week revealed that some of Microsoftâs executives felt ChatGPT was being launched too fast, largely because kinks were still being worked out. OpenAI, meanwhile, had suggested Microsoft move slower on integrating its AI technology with Bing.

Both parties in Congress have expressed concerns with AI, including Rep. McHenry, who is worried about privacy and other risks associated with the fast-rising technology.

940,2023-04-26T09:27:00+00:00,Meta Is All About AI These Days But The Metaverse Is Still In The Air,"While AI has long been on the activity schedule of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the social technology and online ad company was often left outside the AI conversation compared to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) who is not only talking about AI, but betting everything on it.Â On Tuesday, Meta revealed its researchers will be able to access a new human-like AI model that can analyze and complete unfinished images with greater accuracy compared to existing models. But despite all the AI-talking, the metaverse is still in the air.

Zuckerberg Touts âIncredible Breakthroughsâ

In a meetingÂ last ThursdayÂ at the Hacker Square pavilion at Metaâs Menlo Park headquarters, Zuckerberg laid out the areas where Meta is using generative AI, emphasizing that over the last year, the company has seen some incredible qualitative breakthroughs.

A New Kind Of Training

Metaâs AI chief stated that current artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT are barely smarter than a dog and that is one of the limitations of generative AI such as the one created by Microsoft and Open AI in ChatGPT.Â LeCun finds that the reason for these models not to have reached human intelligence is because they areÂ solely trained on languageÂ which is why Meta is training AI on video as well, which is a more challenging task.

I-JEPA

Unlike other generative AI models that only look at nearby pixels,Â Metaâs model will fill in the missing pieces of images by usingÂ background knowledge about the world. That approach is the the kind of human-like reasoning advocated by Meta's AI chief, Yann LeCun, as it helps the technology to avoid errors that are common to AI-generated images, such as hands with extra fingers.

Meta Does Not Believe That AI Is AÂ Threat

Metaâs executives have dismissed warnings about the potential dangers of further AI research, declining to sign a statement last month that backed by top executives from OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) who equated its risks with pandemics and wars.Â The letter, which contained over 31,000 signatures, included even Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk who believes AI is one of the biggest risks to the future of civilization.Â Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) CEO Alex Karp believes that those are calling for a pause are doing so because they donât have a product in store. The AI believers are very much in the A.I. race, and these players believe it is only a question of whether they will keep leading or admit defeat.

This debate was perhaps best explained byÂ Jacques Attali at Wednesdayâs Viva Tech conference. The French economic and social theorist put it simple: if AI is used for a bad purpose such as to develop weapons and fossil fuels, it is terrible, but if it gets used to serve healthcare, education and culture, it can be extraordinary. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella can no longer imagine life without AI and is beyond excited for the world it can help create.

AI Is The Way Forward Towards The Metaverse

Besides trying its AI tools internally, Meta will provideÂ Instagram users with tools that can help them modify photos via text prompts as it continues incorporating generative AI features into all of its consumer products.

Meta is also bringing AI-generated stickers to MessengerÂ and says they are just the âtip of the icebergâ of whatâs coming.Â Ahmad Al-Dahle, Metaâs vice president of AIÂ explained that with AI-generated stickers, users are gaining an infinite range of options for self-expression.Â Al-Dahle adds that the company is also âworking on AI models that are going to transform any image you want in any way you wantâ,Â such as the ability to turn a picture into a painting. Meta is certainly showcasing its AI creations, but itâs still struggling with an identity crisis since it changed its name from Facebook to Meta, with the metaverse still being far from reality. But during the latest earnings call, Zuckerberg assured investors that the new focus on AI does not mean Meta is abandoning its metaverse plans as this technology will be used to develop the virtual world, especially to create the 3DÂ visuals for the metaverse that, for now, is still only a word and an idea.

941,2023-04-26T08:11:37+00:00,How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ Rally,"In this piece we will talk about how to play the AI boom and the NASDAQ rally according to hedge fund manager Brad Gerstner.

One of the craziest trends these days is artificial intelligence. If you had asked the biggest hedge fund and analyst gurus last year if artificial intelligence would be dominating the airwaves as the next big thing this year, very few would have comfortably predicted this. Yet, here we are, and it's all because of a chatbot called Chat GPT.

Ever since the first news of how ChatGPT was one of the strongest artificial intelligence powered conversational chatbots to be programmed, the media is full of how this is the age of AI and thousands of jobs are at risk. These reports are fueled by investment banks as well. For instance, a report from the investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates that AI could cost a stunning 300 million jobs - compare this with the population of the U.S., which sits at close to 332 million according to the latest estimates. However, the investment bank adds that while jobs will be lost, new ones will be added as well along with a productivity boom from those workers that have kept their jobs improving their output.

At the same time, for the savvy investor, artificial intelligence is nothing short of a boon. In fact, it's a ray of hope in a market that is consistently plagued with the worry of a recession and the specter of rising interest rates. And, there's one investor whose quite vocal about the benefit of artificial intelligence and the companies that are at the heart of this latest technological revolution. This investor is none other than Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital. When compared to some of the hedge fund behemoths in the financial industry which have portfolios worth tens of billions of dollars, Altimeter holds its ground with Insider Monkey's research showing that it had a portfolio of $4.5 billion as of the first quarter of this year.

Mr. Gerstner recently made an appearance on CNBC, where he was nothing short of praise for artificial intelligence. In his talk, he shared that while the concerns of AI impacting the job market are valid; nevertheless, the market has seen a similar chorus each time a disruptive new technology surfaces. He outlined one such example in the form of the Internet and the talk around in the late 1990s - when some had worried that people would stop reading books due to the Web. However, right now, according to the hedge fund boss, the world is better now than it was back then - and we'd like to add that books are still sold today as well.

While we'll get into Mr. Gerstner's pure play AI stock picks a bit later, one company that he mentioned during his interview was the Cupertino, California technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple held its World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2023 and the event saw the first new product from the company in years. The Apple Vision Pro is a computer in a headset, or what Apple calls 'Spatial Computing'. At the heart of this remarkable gadget is AI's close cousin, machine learning. Machine Learning is used as part of the headset's Persona feature that scans a user's face and creates a virtual representation for features such as video calling. Additionally, it also uses complex algorithms to track a user's eyes during use. Apart from Apple, he couldn't stop gushing about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) either and thinks that it will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the consumer facing side of AI.

However, while Apple's busy being Apple, Mr. Gerstner's favorite stock for artificial intelligence is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). In his previous talk with CNBC, which came after NVIDIA's stunning results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2024, he shared:

One of the most difficult things about the investment game is behavioral lock in, right. It is making a decision today based upon a failure or success yesterday. And everyday you have to take a first principles approach, you have to take a bottoms up with all the new knowledge that you now possess as to what you should do today. So as we sit here today, you know there are just some significant things I think that you have to take into account. Number one, at the start of the year the consensus estimate among all of the world's best sell side analyst on NVIDIA was that it was going to have negative data center growth in Q1, and zero to ten percent data center growth for the year.

As of yesterday, the company has told us it's going to be closer to ninety or a hundred percent growth. So if you're playing at home, don't feel be bad. The people who do this for a living, on January 1st, thought that it was going to have negative data center growth. So we're early in this AI transition; the company is clearly repriced, but knowing what we know now, the price that the company had on January 1st made no sense, the price in December made no sense. As I came on your show and said in December and January. So, as I look at it today, the stock's trading at you know, yesterday was trading at roughly 65 times earnings, today it's trading close to 55 times earnings. Previously it was trading at you know at something like you know 42 times next year, 2025 consensus or 52 times. Now it's trading at 42 times. So take into account the information today, this is not a fad, AI is not a fad. Every enterprise is going to have to re architect around this. And what we're seeing in terms of their numbers, I think is the leading edge of the AI wave.

So, what stocks are on Mr. Gerstner's mind? Well, we'll look at his portfolio today, and some top picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ Rally According To Hedge Fund Manager Brad Gerstner

The stock market is made up of thousands of companies. Combined with the fact that the regular, retail investor has an unprecedented amount of data available to them for making decisions, this makes investing appear to be a tedious task where one is always at the risk of either missing out on the next Apple or making a blunder based on missing out on a key piece of information.

These apparent traps are compounded by the fact that these days the stock market is at continuous odds with what most people think will happen. The American conversation has been full of predictions of a recession after the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike cycle made conducting business quite difficult. With the fear of a recession on the horizon, the stock market doesn't perform too well either. However, the market is doing just fine. Don't believe us? Well, the NASDAQ 100 index is up by 34% year to date, the S&P 500 has gained 12%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has returned 1.8%, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) still hasn't lost money.

So this makes us wonder if listening to all the predictions of gloom and doom is really worth it. Well, they might be since the market these days is responding to sector specific trading signals. This is evident when we look at the NASDAQ's gains. The index, dominated by the technology sector, is seeing a recovery in the industry that was gutted in 2022. And the others, particularly the S&P and the NYSE, which are a balanced bunch representing firms from all walks of lives, are wary of a broader softening environment in the wake of a year long battle with inflation and high interest rates.

As if this weren't enough, there are some folks who believe that a recession might be a good thing for the stock market. Or at least that's what the chief executive officer of Destination Wealth Management Mr. Michael Yoshikami believes. In an interview with CNBC in late May, the head of the firm that enables the rich to manage their money shared his take on the current back and forth in the media about a recession. His thinking really isn't that complicated, and it involves understanding the actions of the Federal Reserve in case the economy does not cool down. Mr. Yoshikami believes that if this is the case then the Federal Reserve might not reduce the interest rates or could even hike them further. Given that stock market sentiment is actually a reflection of investors' estimates of what will happen in the future, a robust economy stands the risk of shaping investor sentiments towards further hikes and as a result making money flow out of the market and into safe haven assets, money market accounts, or bank savings accounts.

Speaking of safe haven, the U.S. dollar has been long considered the asset of choice for risk aversion fueled by the fact that the U.S. government is unlikely to fail its debt obligations. While the U.S. might not fail anytime soon as both Congress and Senate just passed another extension of the debt ceiling, the current macroeconomic environment might not bode well for the Treasury this time around. At least that's what is on the mind of Otavio Costa, Portfolio Manager at Crescat Capital. In a recent Twitter thread, he shared that after the debt deal, Treasury is likely to issue debt fast, but as opposed to previous issues, this time around it might not find willing buyers. According to Mr. Costa, foreign investors will consider the effects of these securities on existing debt held by banks and the risk of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Higher rates reduce the price of current bonds and the risk of future interest rate hikes makes investors wary of buying more debt due to this fact. The soft treasuries market also reduces the appetite for U.S. bonds for central banks, and according to the portfolio manager, if central banks consider making gold account for 40% of their reserves, they could inject as much as $32 trillion into the gold market to cause the price to shoot by a whopping 25%.

So is gold primed to shine and should you bid farewell to the stock market? Well, Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments believes that gold is quite volatile, explaining that:

There's nothing wrong with gold. It's a commodity, it's volatile. The fact is sometime people think of it this way, sometimes they think of it that way. Lately they've been thinking maybe it's an inflation hedge. Mind you, over all those decades I just talked to you about, there was always inflation. You follow that? And it didn't hedge that inflation very well. Number two, what can we say about it in the very long term? That it has a return that's positive, a little bit lower long term average than, let's say, long term U.S. Treasury Bonds. With a higher volatility then bonds. That doesn't shock you very much. Because bonds are expected to have fairly low volatility. Mind you on the other hand over those same time periods, very long time period, it has about the half the return of stocks, with an actually markedly higher volatility than stocks. That's the point that surprises people. Lower return, higher volatility. Gold gets about 80% of its, maybe 85% of its long term total return from about 15% of time periods. Whereas stock thrives about two thirds of the time period, bond thrives a little more than that. If you can predict gold, you need no advice from me whatsoever.

Mic. Drop. So, it's not gold, it's not bonds, but it's stocks. To make your journey easier, we took a look at some A-rated stocks and decided to see which have received the blessings of billionaires.

943,2023-04-26T05:07:50+00:00,"Google takes millions from pro-life groups masquerading as abortion clinics in deceptive ads, study finds","Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last summer, itâs been a tense period for women seeking abortion services, especially in the 14 states that have criminalized it or the other six with restrictions on when the procedure can be done. As if that wasnât enough, though, many women turning to Google to find information about abortion providers are being shown ads that point them to fake clinics that pretend to offer such services but ultimately try to persuade people against abortions. Google is making millions from the exercise and women are often misled, to say the least, in their search for reliable health services.

Pro-life groups are pushing out these deceptive advertisements for those seeking abortion services on Googleâs platform, according to a new report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a non-profit group focussing on online hate and misinformation, published Thursday.

âGoogle is a willing participant and supporter of the fake clinic industry, profiting from â and even subsidizing â the anti-choice lobbyâs campaigns,â CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed said in the report. âIt is the lynchpin of a multi-million dollar fake clinic industry that works around the clock to deprive Americans of medical assistance by deceptive means.â

The fake clinics, often called crisis pregnancy centers, have proliferated around the U.S. and have spent $10.2 million on search ads in the last two years, CCDH found. Of those clinics, over 70% offer misleading claims about abortion while about 40% of them promoted abortion pill reversalâa method to supposedly reverse an abortion that isnât backed by science.

The deceptive ads boosted by these pro-life groups often pop up in the search about abortion clinics, side-tracking women seeking medical support. CCDH found a family of 15,000 search queriesâsuch as âabortion pill,â âabortion clinic near meâ or âplanned parenthood""âfor which the fake clinics showed up as results. And somehow, those clinics have defied Googleâs existing policies governing abortion clinics in search results and manage to reach vulnerable users.

When reached for comment, Google did not deny that these ads have appeared on its platform, but it laid out its guidelines.

âWe require any organization that wants to advertise to people seeking information about abortion services to be certified and clearly disclose whether they do or do not offer abortions. We do not allow ads promoting abortion reversal treatments and we also prohibit advertisers from misleading people about the services they offer,â Googleâs spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. âWe remove or block ads that violate these policies. We know that people come to Google looking for information they can trust during deeply personal moments and are committed to ensuring advertisements on this topic are clear and easily understood.â

If a search query is general and doesnât indicate that a person is looking for abortion services, ads may sometimes fail to show disclosures regarding the services offered, according to Google. But the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said it âreviewed the advertisersâ and has taken âenforcement actionâ against those violating its content policies regarding abortion reversal.

This isnât the first time the search giant has come under fire for its policies with respect to CPCs. In August, Bloomberg reported that Google Maps queries had misled users looking for abortion services by pointing them in the direction of CPCs.

âIf Google is a pro-science organization, or even just neutral, they would not want to lead people to these places with false advertising that can be harmful to their lives,â Allison Cowett, the medical director of Chicago-based Family Planning Associates, told Bloomberg.

Last year, Fortune reported that CPCs were thriving in a well-funded environment and had outnumbered abortion clinics by a ratio of three-to-one across the U.S.

And while Google says it is frequently reviewing and updating its policies surrounding abortion-related ads, many are clearly falling through the cracks and guiding people in the wrong direction.

Google has 246 million unique users in the U.S., according to online marketing platform Semrush. And over the years, it has built a reputation among users for being a trusted platform for people looking for information about just about anythingâmedical or not. Women looking for abortion-linked services have also turned to the platform, thinking it to be credible in the information it provides.

âThis represents a failure by Google to be honest with its users and protect them from harm,â the CCDH report said.

944,2023-04-26T04:00:29+00:00,Nine out of ten developers admitted using A.I. coding tools in a GitHub survey that shows just how quickly A.I. is invading the workplace,"The stereotype of a lone wolf coder doesnât ring true these days. At most companies, software developers work in packsâand increasingly, they're doing so with the help of A.I.-based assistants.

According to a new survey of U.S.-based developers by GitHub, 92% of respondents say they now use A.I. coding tools at work and for outside projects. The findings underscore how rapidly new generative A.I. tools are being adopted within businesses, albeit among a highly tech-savvy group of workers.

GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, makes one of the most popular such tools. Known as GitHub Copilot, the âpair programmerâ can explain code, make suggestions, and fix bugs with a recent integration of OpenAIâs GPT-4 model. Competition among A.I. coding tools is heating up, with Google announcing its competitor to GitHub Copilot at its I/O developer conference in May. And a number of similar A.I. coding tools are also available, including Amazon's CodeWhisperer, Tabnine, and online platform Replit.

GitHub partnered with Wakefield Research to survey 500 U.S.-based developers at enterprise companies. The survey takers were mostly men in their 30s and 40s at organizations with more than 1,000 employees, reports Gergely Orosz, author of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter.

Many of the developers surveyed in the report said the tools helped them get into a better flow. âThey feel more fulfilled because of the fact that theyâre able to focus in on more meaningful work; on the reasons that they became developers in the first place,"" said Christopher Harrison, senior enterprise advocate at GitHub.

GitHubâs chief product officer Inbal Shani described the benefits of today's crop of A.I. coding tools as a major improvement from the start of her career decades ago, when she experimented with A.I. in the lab. Back then, it took her teamâs models five days to process larger datasets.

âI yearned for tools that would make me more efficient and shorten my time to production,â Shani wrote in an introduction to the survey.

Still, the spread of A.I. tools throughout organizations is raising concerns among some managers.

Google-parent company Alphabet recently warned its employees not to make ""direct use"" of computer code with Google's Bard A.I. chatbot, because the bot can make unwanted code suggestions, according to Reuters.

And while developers may feel a confidence boost from their assistants, A.I. tools havenât always bested developers who rely on their own abilities.

In a November 2022 paper, computer scientists at Stanford University looked at how users interact with an A.I. code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks. Those who had access to an A.I. assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access, yet were more likely to think they wrote secure code compared to those who didnât use an A.I. assistant.

Still, the researchers were hopeful that as improvements are made, the tools could result in higher productivity and bring other advantages like lowering barriers to entry and opening up accessibility in software development. GitHub recommended that companies establish standards for using A.I. tools so that theyâre used ethically and effectively.

And thereâs absolutely nothing wrong with that. But your portfolio also needs a firm foundation, and thatâs where you look for reliable blue-chip stocks.

The best long-term reliable blue-chip stocks are those you can safely rely upon to give you performance over an extended period. They represent established and successful companies with a track record of financial stability and dominate their markets.

And while every stock has its ups and downs, reliable blue-chip stocks usually have lower volatility than smaller, less-established companies. They can withstand downturns better than their competitors.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I used the Portfolio Grader to identify several reliable blue-chip stocks for long-term investors. Here are seven that come to mind.

MSFT Microsoft $337.34 NFLX Netflix $440.86 GOOG Alphabet $123.67 CSCO Cisco Systems $50.96 WMT Walmart $156.87 NVDA Nvidia $429.97 AAPL Apple $183.95

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was already one of the best-known blue-chip stocks even before it helped unleash ChatGPT on the world. The chatbot developed by OpenAI (with some Microsoft investment) uses artificial intelligence to generate instant human-like responses to queries.

Itâs a fantastic technology that helped push MSFT stock up 40% in 2023. But this is only the beginning. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne estimates AI could add $100 billion to Microsoftâs annual revenue by 2027.

Earnings for the first quarter included revenue of $52.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.45, beating expectations of $51.02 billion and EPOS of $2.23.

MSFT stock has a âBâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) wasnât the best investment for several years. The stock dipped severely in 2018 and 2019 as competing streaming services came online.

True, numbers and viewership returned during the Covid-19 lockdowns when everyone turned to screen time to amuse themselves. But those gains didnât last long, and Netflix stock lost 72% of its value from its coronavirus peak until mid-2022.

But now the stockâs on a resurgence. And itâs primarily because Netflix decided to monetize its product by (finally) cracking down on password sharing.

For years, Netflix gave a wink and a nod to the practice of shared passwords. It even became somewhat of a cultural touchstone if a friend or former partner wanted to sever a relationship entirely. A surefire way to do it was to change their Netflix password.

But as NFLX stock continued to fall and Netflix struggled to grow daily active users, it finally took action. You can still share your password with someone who doesnât live in your home, but now you have to pay an additional $8 monthly.

Netflix estimates that 43% of its customers share passwords â roughly 100 million customers. Thatâs a lot of money on the table, and Netflix should be able to pocket a decent amount.

NFLX stock has an âAâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Few companies are as big as or as well-known as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The companyâs dominant search engine is so famous that itâs essentially a verb at this point â how many times have you said or heard someone say, âJust Google it?â

Alphabet is the king of search, owning 86% of the market share. Advertising makes up about 80% of Alphabetâs revenue, $69.8 billion in the first quarter.

Even though advertising spending has been down for nearly a year, the global ad market is expected to grow from $550 billion in 2022 to $800 billion this year. That bodes well for Alphabet as a reliable blue-chip stock.

Alphabet also is a player in the growing cloud market. Google Cloud revenue came in at $7.5 billion in the first quarter, a 28% increase from a year ago.

Itâs also finally released a new version of Google Search thatâs powered by generative AI and designed to compete with Microsoft Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT. That should help it defend its position in the search market.

GOOG stock has a âBâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Cisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking and communications company that connects people and devices across the internet. The company hasnât grown as quickly as others on this list â CSCO stock is up only 6%, compared to the Nasdaq compositeâs return of nearly 30%.

But as a reliable blue-chip stock, youâre investing in Cisco for the long haul. And the future is undoubtedly bright. Cisco expects moderate revenue growth in the fiscal year 2024, which begins this September. As supply chain issues with computing gear continue to improve, Cisco will clear out its backlog of orders and improve its numbers even more.

Earnings for the companyâs fiscal second quarter was $13.6 billion, a 7% increase from a year ago. CSCO stock has a âBâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Arkansas-based Walmart (NYSE:WMT) isnât just any retailer. The company is the worldâs biggest retailer. It now has 10,500 stores around the world.

While a recessionary environment (something that the Federal Reserve warns is still a possibility) and high inflation is never good for retail stocks, Walmart has the advantage of being a discount retailer.

That means that customers are more inclined to get household goods and groceries at Walmart than other stores because itâs seen as having better value and prices.

Earnings for the fiscal 2024 first quarter included revenue of $152.3 billion, up 7.6% from a year ago. Comparable store sales in the U.S. were up 7.4%, and international sales increased 12.9%. E-commerce was also a strong revenue driver, gaining 27% from a year ago.

WMT stock is up nearly 10% so far this year. And if you like dividends, youâll appreciate that Walmartâs increased its dividend annually for more than 50 years.

WMT stock has a âBâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a laptop screen trading stock market

Generative AI is also helping to propel Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to unexpected heights. The chip maker makes equipment that powers ChatGPT, and its success and the rise of AI created an increase in demands from computing and generative AI end users.

Nvidia increased its revenue target for the second quarter from $7.2 billion to $11 billion, which sparked a 25% jump in NVDA stock in a single day. Nvidia is now up over $1 trillion in market cap, as the stock increased 180% this year.

Iâm expecting that trend to continue. Analysts are increasing their price targets for NVDA stock, and the consensus price target is now $460. That indicates another 12% gain for Nvidia is still possible.

NVDA stock has an âAâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

A $1 trillion market cap is pretty impressive, but thatâs small potatoes compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The maker of Mac computers and the iPhone sports the biggest market cap for a publicly traded company globally, reaching $2.8 trillion. A $3 trillion market cap is likely in the cards soon.

Apple is always good at coming up with new or improved products, and it featured several that are powered by machine learning at this yearâs annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

But what I like just as much is Appleâs powerful Services division, which includes things like the App Store and Apple Cloud. The App Store, in particular, is a significant revenue generator for Apple because it merely hosts products that other developers create and want to sell or distribute.

Apple takes a percentage of the sales as its cut. That means it gets revenue without going deep into research and development, giving the Services division better profit margins.

Apple is having a spectacular year, up 41%. It has a âBâ rating in the Portfolio Grader.

951,2023-04-25T23:59:42+00:00,Google is warning its staff to beware of the risks posed by A.I.âincluding its own,"Google fears inherent vulnerabilities in artificial intelligence chatbots could leak sensitive corporate information, raising questions over the suitability of its own BardAI product for commercial use.

Citing unnamed sources briefed on the matter, Reuters reported on Thursday that the $1.6 trillion tech giant warned employees not to input certain types of data into advanced chatbots for fear it could be exploited. That warning included its own entrant in the A.I. race.

âDonât include confidential or sensitive information in your Bard conversations,â stated a Google privacy notice that was updated at the start of June, according to the newswire.

Not only can human reviewers read the chats, but researchers found that similar A.I. can reproduce the data fed into it to train its neural net, creating a backdoor leak.

A.I. race

Big Tech has been locked in a race over who can develop the first killer applications based on generative artificial intelligence. Microsoft affiliate OpenAI struck the first blow against Googleâs DeepMind by unveiling ChatGPT on Nov. 30, taking the world by storm.

Amid all the hype over generative A.I.'s ability to pass professional entrance tests like the bar exam, concerns have already begun to arise however due to its penchant to âhallucinateââpresenting inaccurate or flat out incorrect information as incontrovertible fact.

Should it prove a security risk as well, there could be potentially serious implications for its commercial use. Google is currently rolling BardAI out in more than 180 countries and in 40 languages, including higher-priced versions for business clients that do not absorb data into public AI models.

Yet if the company cannot trust even its own chatbot to prevent its corporate secrets from being reverse engineered by rivals, how can its customers ultimately?

Google's A.I. track record has not exactly been reassuring, either.

Google's perceived lackadaisical behavior towards ethical A.I. questions indirectly led Elon Musk to co-found its main rival, OpenAI, while Googleâs own A.I. employees nearly revolted at one point over its decision to work for the Pentagon.

Last year Google fired a software employee who falsely claimed the companyâs artificial intelligence had achieved sentience. Large language models in fact merely mimic human intelligence by using probability to predict correct outcomes.

Finally, in its haste to keep up with OpenAI, Google rushed out the presentation of BardAI in February, including a promotional video that unwittingly revealed how error-prone it was. This early example of a chatbotâs tendency to hallucinate temporarily cost parent company Alphabet $100 billion in lost market value.

Google did not respond immediately for comment, but in a statement made toÂ Reuters, it did not deny the report.

953,2023-04-25T23:13:13+00:00,Ex-Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer says her experience as a startup founder is inspired by her former Google bosses Larry Page and Sergey Brin,"Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle is making big moves as a new CEO, a British baronessis behind California's social media law, and Marissa Mayer is a founder now. The Broadsheet will be off on Monday to observe Juneteenth. Have a great weekend!

- CEO to founder. Marissa Mayer has had a storied career in Silicon Valley, from employee No. 20 at Google to Yahoo CEO. But until recently, she'd never held that other lauded Silicon Valley title: founder.

Mayer has spent the past few years building what is now Sunshine, an A.I.-powered contacts tool. She joined us at a Fortune Most Powerful Women dinner in Menlo Park, Calif., this week to talk about that career pivot. Even though she hasn't herself been a founder before now, she said, she's spent years surrounded by them.

""My whole career has been based around my interactions with great entrepreneurs,"" she told Fortune editor-at-large Michal Lev-Ram. ""I got to witness and work with the best,"" she said, name-checking Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Marissa-Mayer-MPW-Palo-Alto-Dinner-2023.B13A3614

In her executive roles at Google and Yahoo, she acquired dozens of companies, requiring her to judge what makes a good founder.

So when she landed on the idea that felt right for her, addressing a major product and design problem, she was ready to become a founder herself. She's bringing her legendary work ethicâweekly all-nighters during her early time at Googleâto a new startup with 25 employees, compared to Google and Yahoo's thousands.

Sunshine's platform aims to simplify and learn from people's digital address books. The typical person has 2,000 contacts, 20% of which are usually ""stale"" with a nonfunctioning phone number or email address, Mayer says. Mayer's goal is for Sunshine to learn information like which contacts are friends and which are colleagues, or even who's a colleague who became a friend or a friend who became a colleague. The platform aims to understand which relationships are on the upswingâwith increased contactâand which are trailing off. With that information, Sunshine can help people better take advantage of their networks, plan events, and more.

As a startup leader, Mayer says she's standing by the management principles that guided her Big Tech executive days. Not all of those were popular, like Yahoo's return-to-office mandate a decade ago. (Sunshine employees also work in the office today.) ""I never ask someone to do something I wouldn't do myself,"" Mayer says. ""And a lot of those values translate regardless of company size.""

954,2023-04-25T23:05:00+00:00,Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Here is What You Need to Know,"Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, indicating a change of +9.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.41 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.27 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $60.21 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.8%. The $248.34 billion and $274.78 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.2% and +10.7%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Alphabet reported revenues of $58.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $1.23 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.54%. The EPS surprise was +10.38%.

Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

956,2023-04-25T22:25:03+00:00,New Google lawsuit aims to curb fake business reviews,"By Blake Brittain

(Reuters) - Alphabet's Google on Friday sued a Los Angeles man and his companies in San Jose, California federal court, claiming he created hundreds of fake business listings on its platforms and sold them to real businesses to lure in unsuspecting customers.

Fake reviews have been a recurring problem on internet commerce sites. Google said in a statement that it filed the lawsuit against Ethan QiQi Hu to ""help put an end to these types of malicious schemes.""

Hu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Google's lawsuit said Hu creates sham businesses that appear in its search engine and Google Maps, using an ""elaborate set of props"" to verify them on video calls with the tech giant's agents.

The lawsuit said Hu keeps a tool bench as a prop to verify fraudulent listings for garage repair, tree cutting and plumbing, and essential oils for verifying fake aromatherapy and reiki therapy businesses.

Google said Hu buys thousands of fake positive reviews to make the businesses appear legitimate. He then allegedly sells the profiles as ""leads"" to real businesses in the same fields, which receive contacts from potential customers who reach out to the fake businesses.

Google said Hu created more than 350 false profiles bolstered by over 14,000 illegitimate reviews.

The lawsuit accused Hu of false advertising, unlawful business practices and violating Google's terms of service. Google asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages and an order to block Hu's alleged misconduct.

The case is Google LLC v. Hu, U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California, No. 5:23-cv-02964.

You can skip our detailed analysis of GARP investment and the performance of these stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends.

If there is one thing the market has taught investors this past year, it is the importance of diversifying portfolios to reduce risk. Choosing stocks in different economic conditions has consistently posed challenges for investors because what works in one market may not work in another. For example, growth and value equities have exhibited varied performances over different time periods and market conditions, making them equally popular among investors. So, combining the elements of both strategies can offer investors a much-needed way out from traditional investment plans. This is where the GARP strategy comes in. Growth at a Reasonable Price, or GARP, is a relatively lesser-known investment approach that seeks to identify companies with sustainable earnings growth and attractive valuations relative to their growth prospects. These companies may operate in industries or sectors with favorable growth trends or possess competitive advantages that can drive their future growth.

Popularized by Peter Lynch, the GARP strategyâs main goal is to avoid the extremes of either growth or value investing, which leads investors to growth-oriented stocks with relatively low price-to-earnings ratios in normal market conditions. If successfully identified, these stocks have the potential to generate positive returns for shareholders. Historically, the S&P 500 GARP Index has delivered higher returns than its underlying benchmark. The index tracks the performance of companies with consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuation, and strong earnings power. Some of the best GARP stocks in the index are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Â In the past 12 months, the index gained 12.7%.

According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 GARP delivered an annual average return of 13.2% from June 1995 to June 2019, compared with a 9.81% growth of the S&P 500. During this period, the S&P 500 Growth Index and the S&P 500 Enhanced Value Index returned 10.41% and 11.83%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the GARP Indexâs risk-adjusted returns during the above-mentioned period were higher than growth and value indices.

CPIâs latest report shows that consumer prices rose 4% this May, down from 4.9% in April. This cooling inflation also signals a pause in interest rate hikes, giving investors room to take a breather from the longest streak of increases. However, this does not imply that the stock market is out of the perils as investors still need meticulous investment plans. BMO Capitalâs chief strategist Brian Belski advised Canadian investors to follow the GARP strategy this year. Here are some comments from the analyst:

âGrowth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) remains one of our key style preferences for Canadian equities in 2023. Furthermore, earnings growth and revision trends are broadly consistent with the S&P 500, suggesting there are likely many opportunities developing in Canada to implement a growth at a reasonable price strategy.â

CNBC report also highlighted remarks of BMOâs analysts about the possible investment strategies to navigate the market uncertainties in the US. The report mentioned that investors should use GARP and dividend growth approaches in the current financial environment. Dividend stocks have proved their mettle in previous inflationary periods, becoming popular among investors.

Our Methodology:

GARP stocks have reasonable valuations and strong growth potential, which means that their P/E ratios are not necessarily as low as value stocks. For this list, we used the S&P 500 GARP Index (SPXGARPP) and identified dividend stocks with P/E ratios below 32 and EPS growth estimates for FY23 above 6%. These stocks were ranked based on the number of hedge funds having stakes in them, according to Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023.

9. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39

P/E Ratio as of June 14: 14.14

Estimated EPS Growth for FY23: 10.73%

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is a Georgia-based multinational shipping company that also specializes in supply chain management operations. In May, Deutsche Bank raised its price target on the stock to $212 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The firm appreciated the company's management and its efforts to prioritize profitable growth.

In the first quarter of 2023, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) generated strong cash. The company's operating cash flow came in at over $2.3 billion and its free cash flow amounted to $1.77 billion. Analysts expect the company to show a 10.73% EPS growth for FY23.

Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:

âWe purchased United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) during the quarter. UPS is a global parcel shipment and logistics company which competes in a global oligopoly with high barriers to entry. UPSâ integrated network is more efficient than its closest peer, as evidenced by its margin profile, free cash flow conversion, and returns on invested capital. The companyâs management team is focusing on profitable growth through its Better, not Bigger strategy which should improve margins and future opportunities for the company. The stock price was down due to market concerns about customer concentration and Amazonâs potential entry into the parcel delivery and logistics market. Additionally, UPS Teamstersâ labor agreement expires on July 31, 2023. The market fears a potential labor strike, significant wage inflation, and shippers moving volume to competitors due to concerns around potential service disruptions. We have incorporated these risks into our value, and we believe its stock price is still discounted.â

For the third quarter, Pool experienced steady growth in maintenance, repair, and renovation. That offset weaker new pool construction. Nevertheless, Poolâs shares dipped by -5% on this report given market concerns on housing and any housing-adjacent companies as interest rates rose.â

960,2023-04-25T21:55:21+00:00,Why our obsession with bull markets is...'bull',"If you listen to what many market commentators and journalists are saying these days, you knowâor think you knowâthat U.S. stocks are in a bull market. Thatâs because on June 8, the Standard & Poorâs 500 Index closed at 4,294, the first day it was more than 20% above its recent low of 3,577 on Oct. 12, 2022.

A 20% rise from a recent low, these people say, means that weâre in a bull market. To which I say, âbull.â

The idea that a 20% rise from a recent low puts us in a bull market has no rational basis that I can see, just as the idea that a 20% drop from a recent high means that weâre in a bear market has no rational basis that I can see.

Calling a bull or bear turn in the market sure does get attention, attracts eyeballs and generates talk. But waiting for supposed bull markets to buyâand waiting for supposed bear markets to sellâdoesnât feel like a rational way to put money to work.

Thatâs especially true of this market, most of whose rise is based on eight stocksâwhich I call the Elite Eight. (See box below.)

Rather than being the zillionth writer to chew over the S&P, I decided to use a much broader, and far less well known, index: the FT Wilshire 5000. Thatâs because the Wilshire, which Wilshire Indexes says currently has 3,480 stocks, covers the total U.S. stock market. That gives us a much better overall picture of whatâs going on than the S&P, with its 503 stocks, does.

In addition, the Wilshireâwhich back in the day really did have about 5,000 stocksâmeasures total return: stocksâ price moves up or down plus reinvested dividends. Thatâs much closer to investorsâ actual experience than measuring just price changes, as the S&P does.

And finally, the Wilshire weight of the Elite Eight was only 24% as of June 13, the date Iâm using for this column, compared with their 27% in the S&P. That makes them a tad less distortive of the total market than of the S&P. But even though the Elite Eight are less than a quarter of the Wilshire, more than two-thirds of the Wilshireâs 14.3% return so far this year comes from those eight stocks.

So if this really is a bull market, weâre looking at a very skinny bull. Skinny bull? The Charging Bull on Wall Street Bull in NYC. (REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)

Thatâs a major reason that some skeptics, including me, think this is an alleged bull market determined by arbitrary numbers. As opposed to a classic bull, in which rational investors are rationally expecting to get ârealâ returnsâreturns substantially over the expected rate of inflationâfor an extended period.

Someone who also doubts that weâre in a bull market is Philip Lawlor, Wilshireâs managing director for market research. Lawlor notes that even though on June 13, the Wilshire was up 21% from its October low, it was still about 10% below its all-time high, set on Jan. 3, 2022.

âItâs trite, itâs extremely naÃ¯ve,â he said of the 20% standard. âPeople want something pithy and succinct,â he told me. âThatâs always driven me batty.â

However, he said, âThatâs not how institutional investors approach markets.â Institutional investors, who Lawlor spends lots of time dealing with, are the biggest factors driving the market. Individual investors make the news, but institutional investors are vastly more influential over the long term.

Lawlor thinks that last yearâs sharp declineâthe Wilshire ended the year down 23% from its Jan. 3 all-time highâwas a temporary break in a long-term upward trend, not a bear market. âInterestingly,â he wrote in a memo he sent me, âthe 2022 drawdown has not broken the real [inflation-adjusted] return up-trend, implying that the cult of equity remains intact.â

Dan Wiener, chairman of Adviser Investments in Newton, Mass., made points similar to Lawlorâs. In a June 13 commentary headlined, ""Why This Bull Market is Full of It,"" Wiener wrote that, âDespite the S&Pâs rise, it remains 8.9% below the record Jan. 3, 2022 highâ¦A simple 20% rise from a bear market low is no bull market in my book. Until the S&P crosses 4796.56, the January 2022 high, the bearâs still get her claws in us.â

So what does all this bull market talk mean to those of us who are retail investors rather than market professionals?

Not a whole lot. Donât get overly excited because you keep hearing that weâre in a bull market, and donât get overly scared when you hear that a bear market is upon us, which will happen sooner or later. Stay invested for the long term. And make sure that youâve got enough staying powerâboth psychologically and financiallyâto follow your plan, whatever that may be.

In other words? Reading and hearing about bull markets and bear markets can be a lot of fun. But donât let that determine what you do with your money.

With more than 1 billion Google users worldwide today, thereâs a good chance that most people in the U.S. used the search engine for work, play or school between 2006 and 2013. If you did, you may be eligible for free money as part of a class-action lawsuit between Google and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

About the Google Class Action Lawsuit

Google has entered into a settlement to avoid litigation and to focus its energy on customer complaints, according to a press release issued by Kroll Settlement Administration.

Google denies any wrongdoing in the case, which alleges that the tech giant improperly shared user search queries with third-party websites and companies.

Anyone who clicked a Google search link between Oct. 25, 2006, and Sept. 30, 2013, can be included in the class-action suit. According to the Kroll Referrer Header Settlement website, each claimant will receive roughly $7.70 if they file an approved claim. That estimate may change as new data regarding legal fees, settlement administration costs and the number of claimants is received.

How to Claim Your Money

You can claim your money by filing online by the deadline of July 31, 2023, or by printing the claim form PDF, filling it out and mailing it to:

Google Referrer Header Privacy Settlement

ATTN: Claim Form c/o Kroll Settlement Administration

P.O. Box 225391

New York, NY 10150-5391

You can find the claim form at refererheadersettlement.com, a website owned by Kroll.

Claim forms must be postmarked by July 31, 2023, for inclusion in the class-action settlement. Mailed claim forms will receive a paper check sent to the address on the form.

You do not need to show proof of your Google searches, but you must affirm that you submitted a search query to Google and clicked on a search result within the United States during that time frame.

To submit a claim form online, you will need to register to receive a Class Member ID. The process is simple and takes just a few minutes. Youâll need your phone number and email address. Once you register, youâll receive an email with your Registration Confirmation and Class Member ID, which is a series of numbers and letters.

Copy and paste that Class Member ID into the website to view your claim form. Fill it out and choose your payment option.

If you want to receive a digital transfer of your money, you will need to submit the claim form online and provide information for a digital deposit via PayPal, Venmo, Zelle or ACH. Direct deposit requires your bank account information. You can also choose to receive a prepaid digital Mastercard compatible with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

The final approval hearing should take place Oct. 12, 2023, which means payments should go out sometime after that date.

What Else You Should Know

As with most class-action lawsuits, you have a choice to opt out.

If you do nothing, you wonât receive any money, but you will waive your right to sue Google regarding claims related to this lawsuit.

You can exclude yourself from the lawsuit by submitting a written request to the settlement administrator, settlement class counsel and defendantsâ counselÂ through the settlement website by July 31, 2023. You will not receive money from the class-action suit but will reserve your right to sue the defendant separately.

You also can object to the settlement but still receive funds if you also file a claim form. You can find an objection form under the documents tab of the Kroll Referrer Header Settlement website.

As with claim forms, all paperwork or online forms related to exclusions and objections must be received or postmarked by July 31, 2023.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, but is up about 3% for the week, its best performance since march. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, or 49 points, and the Nasdaq fell 0.5%.

Technology stocks were the drag on the broader market, paced by a 1% decline in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), while semiconductor stocks also ran out of steam following an AI-led rally.

Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), however, rose more than 1% after lifting its annual outlook on earnings following quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

The software maker said that it was focused on âadoption (not revenue) near-term, and that any 4Q/Nov AI revenue lift will be immaterial and it will announce pricing details later this year,â UBS said, though adding that most investors are likely to âstay patient.â

Defensive sectors of the market including utilities and consumer staples, meanwhile, were in the ascendency, pointing to some investor caution ahead of the long Juneteenth weekend and possible profit taking following a rip-roaring rally in stocks.

On the economic front, a preliminary reading of U.S. consumer sentiment on the economy rose more than expected in May, while near-term inflation expectations fell to a two-year low, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed Friday.

The positive data, however, arenât likely to impact âthe chances of a July hike,â said Jefferies, noting that the âlevels of inflation expectations are too high, but the pace of change is encouraging.â

The Federal Reserve earlier this week paused rate hikes, but lifted its projection, or dot plots, on rates, forecasting two more hikes this year.

Some on Wall Street, however, arenât convinced that the Fed will deliver further hikes and continue to bet that the Fedâs tightening cycle is over.

âWe dismiss the dot plot completely â it has almost no utility as a predictive piece of data,â Jay Pelosky, TPW Advisory Founder and Principal said in a Friday note. âWe are not alone in this point of view,â Pelosky added, citing analysis by Bloomberg showing âthe median forecast rarely, if ever, coordinated with actual policy rates.""

The deals could involve a subscription-style fee for media organizations' content to develop the technology powering chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.

Media groups voiced concern over the threat to the industry from AI and feared the misuse of their content by OpenAI and Google. A deal would define news organizations' dealings with generative AI companies globally.

The final report by the panel, released on Friday, also said major suppliers of smartphone operating systems (OS) should be obliged to offer users alternative ways to obtain apps in a secure manner other than their own app stores.

Apple's iOS and Android from Alphabet's Google roughly split Japan's mobile OS market.

Apple allows users to download iPhone apps only through its own app store, while both Apple and Google require software developers to use proprietary payment systems that charge commissions of up to 30%.

The report said that necessary legislative measures will be looked into next, while the Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Saturday the government aims to submit a related bill to parliament as early as next year.

Members of the government panel include Industry Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura and Economy Minister Shigeyuki Goto.

Though Red Bullâs Max Verstappen appears to be walking away with the championship for the Constructors', or team, Championship, many of the outfits are battling to establish the pecking order, for you see in F1, the more competitive the team is, the more prize money they get.

McLaren Racing, one of the legendary teams up there in F1 lore like Ferrari and Williams, is celebrating its 60th year as an F1 constructor. CEO Zak Brown, a long-time vet of the racing scene both in F1 and other series, is slowly trying to bring the team back after a recent lull in its history.

For Brown, F1âs popularity, and his own teamâs success, depends on a strong US âone that many automakers involved in F1, and McLarenâs own road car business, depends on for a majority of sales. McLaren CEO Zak Brown speaks during a news conference in advance of the Formula One Miami Grand Prix auto race, Friday, May 5, 2023, at the Miami International Autodrome in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)

""I think it's early days, which is amazing,"" Brown said of the Formula 1âs US appeal, which started around the time Netflixâs âDrive to Surviveâ series started five years ago. ""A lot of people are saying, 'How long do you think it will continue? And my answer is, 'I think we're actually just getting started, right? We haven't even had Las Vegas yet.'""

The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix is coming this year, under the lights, in mid-November. This follows F1âs return to the US with a semi-permanent race in Austin, and two races in Miami which began last year. Brown notes F1âs success has led to a new TV contract in the US with ESPN, with ratings still relatively strong.

This of course has lead to blue-chip US companies like Oracle, Chipotle, Workday, and AutoNation joining the sponsorship ranks.

Brown, who cut his teeth bringing in sponsors for various race teams he worked for after his career as a racer, has seen McLaren boost its sponsorship numbers tremendously since he took the reins a few years back. And the big names appear here to stay.

""The Googles, the Goldman Sachsâ, the Coca-Colas â these are unbelievable companies that are now entering the sport and seeing how big and powerful our sport is,"" he said. Alphabetâs Google and Goldman joined McLaren last year as official sponsors, with Coke joining two years ago.

From McLarenâs end, even a somewhat uneven global macro environment hasnât dissuaded corporate sponsorship.

""Not yet, and I keep saying not yet because I'm waiting for it to come,"" Brown joked. ""I think the sport is doing so well, that the âgood stuff in lifeâ seems to be â I don't want to say a recession proof because I don't want to jinx it â but we're not seeing it. Our numbers are up. We're a profitable Formula 1 team for the first time in about 10 years.""

(Photo by Bryn Lennon - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images)

One of the big reasons why US sponsors are excited is, as mentioned above, the third race coming to the US â and thatâs Vegas. And with the checkered flag dropping on a Saturday night (a first for F1 that usually races on Sunday), itâs going got be all eyes on the Strip.

""I think it's going to be probably the largest global sporting event in the world this year, I can't think of something that's going to be bigger,"" Brown said. ""The excitement is going to be off the charts, and I can't wait to see everyone who shows up - it's going to be the celebrities, the athletes, the CEOs, and, of course, hundreds of thousands of fans.""

Case in point â if you want to get tickets for the Las Vegas Grand Prix you are out luck â itâs sold out. The only tickets available are standing room, and special VIP packages that cost thousands of dollars.

974,2023-04-25T20:40:03+00:00,When Should You Buy Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?,"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the companyâs outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Alphabetâs outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.

Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet

What's The Opportunity In Alphabet?

Good news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $160.46, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Alphabetâs share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future.

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so letâs also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 57% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If youâve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isnât fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means itâs not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.

975,2023-04-25T20:40:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Is Worried About AI. Here's How He's Betting Big on It Anyway.,Warren Buffett isn't what you'd call a tech guru. The legendary investor has been notoriously slow in the past to invest in companies with major technological advances. He readily admits that tech is outside of his wheelhouse.
976,2023-04-25T20:36:30+00:00,Meet the little-known first Black woman to sit on a Fortune 500 corporate board,"Who was the first Black woman to join the board of a large U.S. public company?

Until recently, a quick Google search would have directed you to Dolores Wharton, a prominent foundation executive who was married to the late Clifton Wharton Jr., former Rockefeller Foundation chair, CEO of TIAA, and university president.

But that information turned out to be incorrect, according to findings unearthed two years ago by Black Women on Boards (BWOB), a networking and board training organization. The first Black woman on a Fortune 500 board, one member discovered, was actually Patricia Roberts Harris, the late American lawyer, cabinet secretary, and diplomat, who was elected to the board of IBM in 1971. (Wharton had joined the boards of Kellogg and Phillips Petroleum in 1976.)

Now Harrisâs featâbreaking into the apex of corporate power once reserved for white menâis not only recognized by the worldâs search engine, itâs also celebrated in OnBoard, a new documentary about Harris and the women who have followed suit, often as the first or only Black woman in the boardroom.

Merline Saintil, cofounder of BWOB and coâexecutive producer and coproducer of OnBoard, says the film is part of a wider mission to normalize Black womenâs corporate success and show fellow Black executives that thereâs a pathway to the boardroom because someone went first.

Patricia Roberts Harris, that someone, was repeatedly first throughout her career.

When she died in 1985, obituaries outlined the remarkable trajectory of her life. She was born into a working-class family in Illinois; attended Howard University on a scholarship, graduating summa cum laude; and worked her way into D.C.âs inner circle. Friends and colleagues described her to the New York Times as a lawyer with a âsteel-trap mindâ and a self-assured leader with a certain âdualityâ about herâat once tough, sharp, and charming.

Harris graduated from the George Washington University Law School, first in her class, in 1960. By the time she got the call from IBM, she had been a corporate lawyer, the dean of Howard University School of Law, an organizer for the Democratic Party, cochair of the National Womenâs Committee for Civil Rights, and the first Black woman to become an ambassador (to Luxembourg). IBM was not her only board; she later served on those of Scott Paper and Chase Manhattan Bank.

Harris left her IBM directorship in 1977 when she was invited to the U.S. cabinet, serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development and later as secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, during the Carter administration.

Before her HUD appointment, she sat for a Senate committee hearing, which produced an exchange that became a part of her legacy. When a lawmaker suggested that Harris, by then among D.C.âs elite, may not be âof the people,â she responded forcefully.

âSenator, to say that Iâm not by, and for, and of the people is to show a misunderstanding of who I am and where I came from,â said Harris. âIf my life has any meaning at all, it is that those who start as outcasts may end up being part of the system.â

That clip helps to anchor and fuel OnBoard, which debuted at New York Cityâs Tribeca Festival this week. In 45 minutes, it deftly threads together Harrisâs story with that of BWOB, which was launched almost accidentally three years ago by two friends: Saintil, a former Silicon Valley CTO and COO who now sits on the boards of Rocket Lab, GitLab, and three other companies, and Robin Washington, Gilead Sciencesâ former CFO, and a director at Salesforce, Alphabet, and Honeywell.

In 2020, they found themselves talking about the surge in requests for Black board members following George Floydâs murder, as major American firms pledged to fix their companyâs race record and diversify their boards. (Although gender diversity has improved over the past few decades, white womenânow holding about one-third of board seatsâhave benefited most. That summer, Black women held only 3% of all Fortune 500 board seats, and 4% of S&P 500 directorships.)

Eager to improve, boards did what boards do: They looked inward, finding Black directors at other companies who might be recruitable. Saintil and Washington were flooded with requests but declined. They had hit capacity. âThe way it works, if youâre on board, youâre getting the calls. If youâre not on board, youâre not getting the calls,â says Saintil. âWe thought, âHey, we know amazing Black women who just arenât getting the calls. Can we do something about that?ââ

Soon after, the pair organized a Zoom call with 18 Black women executives, which organically evolved into a formal venture. Today, BWOBÂ has more than 200 members globally and more than 30 women placed on public company boards.

Shannon Nash, CFO of Wing, a drone delivery company and Alphabet subsidiary, was among the boxed faces at that Zoom gathering. Her idea was to hire Atlanta-based film director Deborah Riley Draper, whose documentaries bring light to Black history, and make a short film about BWOBâs mission. The multi-hyphenate executiveâlawyer, CPA, film producer, and board member at SoFi bank and two other firmsâshared her proposal with Saintil and Draper in the fall of 2021, during a short trip that began as a vacation.

At the impromptu offsite, the women searched Google for the first Black woman on a board and were led to Wharton. But just two weeks later, Nash learned from Barry Lawson Williamsâthe retired founder of investment and consulting firm Williams Pacific Ventures, who has served on more than 18 public boardsâthat Harris was the real trailblazer. He knew because his mother had idolized Harris and followed every move in her career.

The revelation gave the women further resolve: They needed to correct the neglected history of Black women in corporate governance. Nash would be the documentary's co-executive producer and producer. âWe often donât include, or center, Black women in the story of big business and corporate boardrooms and capitalism, and the interesting thing about that is Black women have been an important part of the American economy since thereâs been an American economy,â says Draper, the filmâs director. Shannon Nash, CFO of Wing and OnBoard coproducer, Deborah Riley Drapper, film director, Merline Saintil, cofounder of Black Women on Boards, and Mikki Taylor, editor-at-large, Essence, at the Onboard debut.

Though the documentary doesnât dive into Harrisâs experiences in corporate boardrooms, it offers a broader history of board diversity, honoring 50 of the women who followed Harris in the â70s, â80s, until today, and interviewing Black women directors at companies like Zillow, Symbotic, and Williams-Sonoma.

Taking this long view helps to put the current climateâwith its anti-woke boycottsâin perspective. The movement to diversify boards wonât be reversed, says Saintil. A just-published board snapshot from Deloitte shows a sharp increase in Black directors, who now hold 12% of Fortune 500 board seats, with Black women seeing the largest increase (a 47% jump) in new placements since 2020. âIt may not continue at the pace it has been in the last few years, postâGeorge Floyd, but the idea that we would turn back and not continue to think of diversity as an advantage and criteria by which we look at things is not possible,â says Saintil. Companies are aware that boardroom diversity leads to stronger performance and better decisions, and groups like BWOB are debunking the myth that there arenât enough Black executives with the right experience to be directors.

In the past, the barriers that kept Black women out of the CFO and CEO positions played into the absence of Black female directors since boards have traditionally been composed of only executives who have held those roles. Today, says Saintil, more Black executives hold such titles, and boards are tapping directors with varied professional backgrounds. âNow you get your technologists, product people, chief marketing people, CHROs, and a wider group of C-suite executives,â she notes. But Black women still lack the social capital required to join boards. They need introductions, robust networks, golf games with CEOs (which BWOB has arranged), and ongoing support once they become a board member, says Saintil.

Like Harris, who was ânot in the self-promotion businessâ according to her contemporaries, Saintil admits that she doesnât love the limelight of her new role. At first, she recoiled at the thought of making a documentaryâdealing with the hair, the makeup, the press appearancesâuntil she considered the impact the film could have. âI know we will inspire people to think more broadly, that they could reach this trajectory. We will educate people on what boards do,â she says, âWe will get people fired up and inspired.â

Google has initiated early conversations with companies including homegrown Lava International Ltd. and Dixon Technologies India Ltd. as well as Foxconn Technology Groupâs Indian unit Bharat FIH, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the matter is private.

Google would be the latest global technology player to move production to India. The potential partners itâs talking to have won Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs so-called production-linked financial incentives, which have boosted local manufacturing. Apple has used the program to widen its supplier base in India and tripled iPhone output to more than $7 billion in the fiscal year through March 2023.

Modi has been pitching India as an alternative manufacturing hub, as more companies are becoming wary of the risks of depending on China after its harsh Covid lockdowns and a trade war between Washington and Beijing. Modi is scheduled to visit the US this week where his delegation is expected to hold talks on topics including a removal of tech trade barriers between the two countries.

Last month, Indiaâs Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw met with Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai at the companyâs headquarters in Mountain View, California, for a conversation that revolved around Modiâs local manufacturing drive and Indiaâs state-backed technology push.

Key Google executives who visited India this month for the partnership talks included Ana Corrales, operating chief of its consumer hardware arm, and Maggie Wei, a senior director of global sustaining product operations, the people said.

Representatives for Lava, Dixon, Google and Foxconn didnât respond to requests for comment.

Google built about 9 million Pixel smartphones last year, according to Counterpoint Research, and the discussions in India underscore its plans to move production beyond China and Vietnam. The Pixel is among the most sophisticated smartphones, and Google uses its flagship hardware product to showcase what its Android operating system and apps are capable of when optimized.

India is a key growth market for Googleâs services but the company has largely watched from the sidelines as cheaper Chinese phones have dominated the region. Local assembly could help drive up Pixel sales, and if the phone effort is successful, Google could also move production of other hardware such as speakers to India, the people said.

Still, there is no certainty Googleâs talks will result in a deal and the company could opt not to build the Pixel in India, the people said.

A clutch of stocks have so far propped up mammoth gains for US indexes in 2023, according to a new analysis.

Broker platform AJ Bell found that just six stocks generated 88% of the S&P 500's gain in total market cap so far this year, which amounted to an increase of $3.8trn (Â£2.97trn). Without those, the index's performance has been underwhelming.

The jump runs contrary to struggles in other parts of the economy, as governments and central banks continue to grapple with the costs of covid and inflation.

At the start of the year there were widespread layoffs among tech giants, signalling a move to an era of cost cutting and margin watching at big companies.

The stock market rally in tech can partially be attributed to the boom in interest in AI, but also investor anxiety about balancing portfolios for ESG. Focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues has spurred a look towards businesses that are less reliant on carbon, meaning oil and gas has lost out.

As companies and investors alike look to shape the future of their business, here are the stocks that have supported bumper gains in 2023 so far.

Alphabet's (GOOG) search buffer

A powerhouse of the tech stock world, Alphabet's Google has continued to woo investors this year as it looks for ways to leverage the AI research unit it has been building over the last decade.

As of mid-June the price per share for Google's Nasdaq-listed stock had risen from $88.71 to $124.06 since the beginning of the year. While its share price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market, investors are still betting on it rising even further.

Google's stock has been propelled by a consensus that it is well positioned to use AI to enhance its advertising and cloud businesses.

""Due to the scale and power of Google's reach, it provides a big layer of insulation in a downturn, and thatâs been evident in Alphabetâs first quarter results showing the benefits of search as such an essential service, despite worries about a looming recession,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Risks remain, though, in how competitors are moving to innovate.

""Microsoft's integration of generative AI into its search engine Bing could threaten the dominance of Google, especially given the launch of its own AI chatbot, Bard, had some teething problems,"" added Streeter. ""The stratospheric rise in AI interest is acting as a rocket for Google Cloud's revenue but this landscape is already shaping up to be ultra-competitive and there is no guarantee that Alphabet will be able to drive into pole position.ââ

Meta's journey from social media powerhouse to ambitious metaverse tech proprietor has had lots of twists and turns over the last year, with billions sunk into a bet that may not work.

Advertising revenue has been in the spotlight with pressure from a potential looming US recession.

""The group relies heavily on ad spend, and this despite the progress, this is still quite a tough place to be as consumer spending and confidence suffers, particularly with competition so tough, with TikTok now a formidable opponent,"" said Streeter.

What's more, The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Meta is struggling to keep up in AI, which is becoming a crucial pillar for the future of tech businesses. WSJ found that around a third of its AI researchers had left the business, either due to layoffs or having left of their own accord.

The challenge will now be to rebuild, catch up with competitors and put its research, which has been so far academic in nature, into practice.

Apple's (AAPL) metaverse bet: Vision Pro

Apple has always been a powerhouse of the tech stock world and 2023 has proved no exception so far.

While Meta's stock was buffeted from its pivot to metaverse tech, Apple seems to have emerged from its Vision Pro headset launch unscathed.

It remains to be seen whether this bet will work, as the headset, reported to cost as much as Â£3,499, sits out of the price range of many average consumers.

Making a bet on Nvidia is tantamount to making a bet on AI hardware. That's according to a recent note by analysts at Morgan Stanley, who raised their price target to $500 from $450 after the company unveiled AI chips.

Shares are already up 200% for the year-to-date earning it a market cap of more than $1trn. So if you'd have invested $1 at the start of the year that would now be worth $3.

""Frankly, the commentary around these markets is more positive than anything we have heard in 29 years of covering semiconductor stocks,"" they said last week.

Following Nvidia's earnings report, Morgan Stanley said it thinks there is still room for the stock to climb, as spending increases by enterprise departments, existing customers and even governments.

Microsoft's (MSFT) audacious AI play

Having started the year at $239.58, and risen to $342.33, Microsoft investors have been laughing all the way to the bank so far in 2023.

An early move into AI, via a partnership with OpenAI (the developer of ChatGPT) has put the company in a strong position ahead of peers, and it has regained losses from last year to trade at all-time highs.

Amazon (AMZN)

Bank of America has plastered a 'buy' sign on Amazon stock as it appears to have emerged from the pandemic stronger than ever.

Having started the year at $85.82 a share, it now sits at $125.49.

Analysts were encouraged by commentary that retail margins could improve beyond pre-pandemic levels. Going forward despite the long list of potential competitors across different sectors such as retail, media and cloud computing.

""The core retail/delivery business was a big beneficiary of cheap labour, cheap energy and fuel, cheap money and cheap goods,"" notes Mould. ""Even then its operating margins were never that fat â mid-single digit at best across the whole group â so if we are entering a new era where all four of those are more expensive then the retail arm does face some potentially large tests, although right now weaker oil prices, Government support schemes and decent pay rises for many are helping to support consumer spending.""

What's next for the S&P?

While investors are cheering and companies get sharp elbowed over AI, the lack of diversity in the S&P 500 could spell trouble for future gains in the index.

""Such a reliance upon a select list is usually a bad sign, not a good one,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. ""The benchmark may need better breadth if it is to kick on and challenge its closing all-time zenith of 4,797 on 3 January 2022.""

Mould added that if something were to go wrong with just one of the top stocks, it could knock out the entire index.

981,2023-04-25T18:50:11+00:00,Opinion: AI-assisted writing is close to becoming as standard as spell check. Here's the catch,"Protesters supporting the Writers Guild in Britain hold signs expressing opposition to artificial intelligence. (SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images)

Soon after ChatGPT was released, an artificial intelligence researcher from one of the big tech companies told me that I shouldnât worry about how the technology would affect how students learn to write. In two years, she assured me, only aspiring professional writers would enroll in writing classes; no one else would need to write anymore.

I remembered that conversation recently when I got advance access to Google Docsâ new âHelp me writeâ feature, which is expected to be rolled out to all users soon. Once you have this feature, it becomes the default in Googleâs word processor: The magic wand appears every time you open a document, ready to generate and revise text for you. If you want to write yourself, you have to close the feature.

Just as itâs hard to imagine life before spell check today, we may soon forget what it was like to open a blank document and start typing without an AI âassistantâ completing â or initiating â our thoughts.

Googleâs âHelp me writeâ is joining a crowded field of AI-powered writing assistants. Microsoftâs Copilot promises to âjump-start the creative process so you never start with a blank slate againâ by providing âa first draft to edit and iterate on â saving hours in writing, sourcing and editing time.â Grammarly promises that its âpersonalized generative AI co-creatorâ will help you âcompose and ideateâ so âyou never have to experience [writing] alone.â

These companies promise their AI assistants will boost our productivity, liberating us from the drudgery of writing so that we can use that time to do more important work. Hereâs the problem: In many cases, writing is the important work.

Writing is hard because the process of getting something onto the page helps us figure out what we think â about a topic, a problem or an idea. If we turn to AI to do the writing, weâre not going to be doing the thinking either. That may not matter if youâre writing an email to set up a meeting, but it will matter if youâre writing a business plan, a policy statement or a court case.

While AI assistants might be able to help us with our own thinking, itâs likely that in many cases theyâll end up replacing that thinking. In a recent article in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Columbia undergraduate Owen Kichizo Terry described using ChatGPT not to edit his own ideas but to generate the substantive components of his college papers, leaving him only to stitch those ideas together. Using AI to generate ideas, create an outline and provide specific instructions for writing each paragraph, Terry wasnât using an AI assistant; he had become the assistant â and so will we.

Once we let the chatbot fill the blank page, the botâs text will shape our understanding of the topic â with whatever limitations, biases and errors go with it. To effectively assess AI-generated drafts, weâll need to be able to ask difficult questions, analyze evidence, consider counterarguments â in other words, to do the same important work we do when we write ourselves. But if we no longer value doing our own writing â if every time we open a Google or Word document, weâre prompted to save time by turning to the bot â we may get to the point when we donât know how to think for ourselves anymore. Even if we donât lose our jobs to AI, weâll lose what matters about them.

I drafted multiple versions of this essay before I got to the version youâre reading now. I didnât use an AI assistant because I was not interested in finding out what an algorithm would predict someone could say about this topic. I wanted to figure out what was troubling me about it.

Here is where I ended up, at least for now: While the rollout of writing assistants is inevitable, our relationship to them, no matter how much tech companies suggest otherwise, is not. If we wave that magic wand uncritically, we risk outsourcing not just the mundane but the meaningful.

Yours truly and Brad Smith are live all week for Yahoo Finance Live from Cannes Lions, the de-facto Super Bowl of the ad industry. In attendance is everyone from Twitter's new CEO Linda Yaccarino (and reportedly her new billionaire boss, Elon Musk) to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel to Spotify founder Daniel Ek. And of course, Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone is in the house crushing it.

We have some potentially stock-price-moving interviews kicking off this morning, so I encourage you to tune in and follow the Yahoo Finance Twitter feed.

With that promo out of the way, I'm here to tell you that after 48 hours on the ground in the Continent, I can definitively say that the AI hype bubble has traveled across the pond.

""Isn't this supposed to be an ad industry event, not Techcrunch Disrupt 2023,"" has been one of my main thoughts up to now.

Buff glistening people â presumably part of the conference in some sort of capacity â are running on along the picturesque beach with AI mentions on t-shirts.

Snapchat is out hyping its various AI and VR efforts in a full-building takeover in front of the beach (so much for the struggling social media platform watching its cost structure).

Meta has one of the larger presences (again, so much for Zuck's ""Year of Efficiency"") at the event from what I can tell â Amazon is probably the largest â and continues to promote new WhatsApp features and what it's doing in AI. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Brad Smith speak with investor and musician Will.I.Am on all things AI. at Cannes Lions.

Pinterest will no doubt discuss its AI efforts (more on those here from a recent chat I had with new CEO Bill Ready who is also in attendance) at its beach house just a few rows down from Yahoo and Google's YouTube.

AI is a topic of interest at most panel discussions, with a keen focus on how the technology will shape the advertising industry.

It's AI mania at yet another event for me this year â I can't outrun the stuff!

And you, the investor, can't outrun it either.

Mere mentions of new AI tools from various tech companies continue to prop up stock prices â and the broader S&P 500. Food companies are playing up the potential of AI on earnings calls. Food companies!

Companies are taking great pains have their marketing and investor relations departments pump up AI in external forums.

This is all getting crazy.

I am not saying generative AI is internet bubble type of stuff â it has true game-changing promise for companies and by extension their profits. But how freely AI is being talked about is becoming a red flag for me from an investment standpoint. When everyone is doing something in investing, it's often wise to question it and consider doing the opposite.

My advice: check your valuations on any company discussing AI, make sure said company is profitable and generating cash and question if what they are working on with respect to AI is truly fresh.

Two great examples of fresh AI projects besides Microsoft and Google are AMD and Salesforce, in my view.

As for me, it's back to the French Riviera...and the AI hype bubble.

The company has initiated early conversations with homegrown Lava International Ltd, Dixon Technologies India Ltd, and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (OTC: HNHPF) Foxconn Technology Group's Indian unit Bharat FIH, Bloomberg cites familiar sources.

Google's potential partners have won India's production-linked financial incentives, which have boosted local manufacturing.

Apple leveraged the program toÂ broaden its supplier base in India and tripled iPhone output to over $7 billion in the fiscal year through March 2023.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pitched the country as an alternative manufacturing hub as companies eye a safer haven from China's harsh Covid lockdowns and a trade war with the U.S.

Local assembly could help drive up Pixel sales, and if the phone effort kicks in, Google could also migrate production of other hardware like speakers to India.

According to Counterpoint Research, Google built about 9 millionÂ Pixel smartphones last year, and the discussions in India underline its plans to move production beyond China and Vietnam.

Key Google executives visited India in June for the partnership talks, including Ana Corrales, operating chief of its consumer hardware arm, and Maggie Wei, a senior director of global sustaining product operations.

In May, India's Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, to discuss local manufacturing drive and India's state-backed technology push.

Price Action: GOOG shares traded lower by 0.56% at $123.36 premarket on the last check Tuesday.

985,2023-04-25T15:00:00+00:00,"Gannett sues Google, alleges online ad monopoly","NEW YORK (Reuters) -Gannett Co Inc, the largest U.S. newspaper chain, on Tuesday sued Google, accusing the social media company of violating federal antitrust law by trying to monopolize the market for online advertising.

The publisher of USA Today and more than 200 daily newspapers in a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan said media are suffering because Google and its parent Alphabet Inc monopolize tools for buying and selling online ads.

Gannett said this forces publishers to sell more ad space to Google at depressed prices, resulting in ""dramatically less revenue for publishers and Google's ad-tech rivals, while Google enjoys exorbitant monopoly profits.""

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Gannett is seeking unspecified damages.

It filed its lawsuit five months after the U.S. Department of Justice brought a similar lawsuit against Google over the Mountain View, California-based company's advertising technology.

On June 14, the European Union filed its own case, and said Google might have to sell some of its advertising technology.

Google generated $224.5 billion of advertising revenue in 2022, accounting for nearly 80% of Alphabet's overall revenue, and posted an overall $60 billion profit.

Advertising allows Google to offer many of its services for free, including email and much of its YouTube video platform.

Google's first-quarter ad revenue was $54.5 billion, little changed from a year earlier.

Like many newspaper publishers, McLean, Virginia-based Gannett has struggled in recent years with falling ad revenue and as more people get their news online.

Gannett said print circulation at its newspapers fell nearly 20% in 2020 and in 2021, and that it has shuttered more than 170 publications since 2019, when it merged with GateHouse Media.

According to the lawsuit, online digital advertising in the United States has grown nearly eightfold since 2009 into a $200 billion business, but newspaper ad revenue has fallen nearly 70% over that time.

The case is Gannett Co v Google LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 23-05177.

986,2023-04-25T14:54:01+00:00,Modi Looks to Solidify Indiaâs Tech Prowess With US State Visit,"(Bloomberg) -- Narendra Modi arrives in the US on his first official state visit with Indiaâs geopolitical clout higher than at any point since he took power in 2014. Heâll be looking to leverage that to become an indispensable partner for American tech ambitions.

The trip will be a high-profile affair, complete with a banquet at the White House and an address to the US Congress, making Modi the first Indian prime minister to speak in front of the legislature twice. Besides meeting US President Joe Biden, he set to catch up with private-sector leaders including Tesla Inc.âs Elon Musk.

For Biden, India offers a diplomatic and military counterbalance to Chinaâs power in the region, at a time when the US is distancing itself from its biggest trade partner and the worldâs manufacturing powerhouse. Both nations see Beijing as a threat, with Biden expanding Trump-era export curbs to China and Modiâs government banning hundreds of Chinese apps in the wake of a border clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead in 2020.

High on the agenda will be removing regulatory constraints to doing business, particularly in the tech space. As the Biden administration seeks to prevent China from obtaining advanced chips and other technology, the US and India are working on ways to promote semiconductor manufacturing in India, according to officials aware of details who asked not to be named since discussions were private.

The frequency of recent contact between officials from both governments has been âunprecedented,â National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last week.

Itâs âall designed to take away whatever the barriers that are keeping us from being able to drive forward,â he added.

Modiâs ambition for India to become a player in chip manufacturing looks far more credible today, after US imports of chips from the South Asian nation multiplied more than 38 times in the first quarter. Apple Inc. tripled iPhone production in India over the past fiscal year as it seeks to reduce its reliance on Beijing, while memory maker Micron Technology Inc., which is under investigation in China, is close to receiving government approval on a $1 billion semiconductor plant.

âIndia as a consumer of technology is now being replaced by an India which is at the table, wanting to frame the standards along with like-minded nations for the future of technology,â Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister who often speaks on behalf of the governmentâs tech policy team, told Bloomberg News in a recent interview.

The technological cooperation with the US is also spilling over to defense. General Electric Co. and Hindustan Aeronautics are set to sign an agreement during Modiâs visit to produce engines for Indiaâs fighter jets. The two sides will have a flexible licensing agreement allowing for the transfer of technology.

âThe US is quite choosy about whom it shares military technology with,â said Manjari Chatterjee Miller, a senior fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. âA deal allowing GE to produce jet engines in India â it will show how seriously the US is taking the partnership.â

US national and business leaders have heaped praise on India even while the government keeps sky-high import tariffs on a range of sectors. To bring more advanced manufacturing within its borders, India has combined these import duties on smartphones with subsidies designed to get assemblers like Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. and Wistron Corp. to set up shop locally.

Itâs worked: Hon Hai plans a $700 million plant for iPhone parts and Samsung Electronics Co. is also looking to expand production.

âIndia presents a unique crucible for technology â successes there are guaranteed to succeed anywhere else in the world,â Sanjay Gupta, the head of Google in India, said at an industry event.

Although India has had some early success with smartphone assembly, helping Apple export more than $7 billion of its devices from the South Asian nation in the last fiscal year, many components are still imported from China. While Indiaâs $10 billion push to make chips is just beginning, questions remain about whether the nation can provide the uninterrupted power and water supply needed by companies that make the most-cutting edge chips, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Modiâs trip comes at a pivotal time for Indiaâs tech ecosystem, where a new digital law is being crafted in consultation â and sometimes in conflict â with big names like Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Twitter. Draft legislation expected within weeks will help determine exactly how big an opportunity India presents to overseas players.

Even as Internet firms pour billions of dollars into the nation on the prospect that itâs a China-sized opportunity without the censorship deployed by the Communist Party, India is also among the top nations requesting content removal. Twitter Inc. has gone to court to fight blocking orders the company says suppress free speech, and organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have called on India to reverse plans to undermine privacy-protecting encrypted communications.

In March, an Indian court upheld an antitrust fine on Alphabet Inc.âs Google over its dominance of mobile platforms. Far from being discouraged, Google is pouring more investment and energy into tailoring its Android software to India, including by expanding the local languages it supports.

Chandrasekhar said in the interview that India has the single-biggest bloc of users in the world with some 830 million people on the internet. That means companies must follow Indiaâs rules if they want a piece of the market, he said, adding that the government doesnât intend to have an âadversarial relationshipâ with anyone.

âDonât be under any illusion that theyâre here for any charitable purposes,â Chandrasekhar said about tech investors in India. âNo other market this big.â

989,2023-04-25T14:17:13+00:00,"Gannett sues Google, Alphabet claiming they have a monopoly on digital advertising","Gannett has filed a civil lawsuit against Google and its parent company Alphabet, claiming that they unlawfully hold monopolies in the advertising technology tools that publishers and advertisers use to buy and sell online ad space.

The largest U.S. newspaper publisher by total daily circulation alleges in the suit that Google controls how publishers sell their ad slots and forces them to sell an increasing amount of ad space to Google at lower prices. This in turn results in less revenue for publishers and Googleâs ad-tech rivals and more money for Google.

In January the Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government. The suit accused the company of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors.

The European Union launched an antitrust investigation into Googleâs digital ad dominance in 2021. And last week EU regulators hit Google with fresh antitrust charges, saying the only way to satisfy competition concerns about its lucrative digital ad business is by selling off parts of the tech giantâs main moneymaker.

The unprecedented decision to push for such a breakup marks a significant escalation by Brussels in its crackdown on Silicon Valley digital giants, and follows a similar move by U.S. authorities seeking to bust Googleâs alleged monopoly on the online ad ecosystem.

Gannett CEO Mike Reed, in an opinion piece published Tuesday by Gannett-owned USA Today, said that the company is looking to ""restore fair competition in a digital advertising marketplace that Google has demolished.""

Reed claims that local news outlets are hurting because of unlawful bid-rigging practices used by Google.

âThe core of the case and our position is that Google abuses its control over the ad server monopoly to make it increasingly difficult for rival exchanges to run competitive auctions,â Reed wrote.

âThese claims are simply wrong. Publishers have many options to choose from when it comes to using advertising technology to monetize â in fact, Gannett uses dozens of competing ad services, including Google Ad Manager,"" Dan Taylor, vice president of Google Ads said in a written statement. ""And when publishers choose to use Google tools, they keep the vast majority of revenue. Weâll show the court how our advertising products benefit publishers and help them fund their content online.â

Gannett's lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeks an unspecified amount of damages and injunctive relief. The Virginia company is seeking a trial by jury."

This is evident from the latest launch of two new AI-backed features to boost automation in its advertisement business, which will help advertisers achieve specific goals for their ads.

One of the features called Demand Gen is designed to take care of the placement of ads, thus automating the process that advertisers were previously required to think about.

The feature would place the photo and video ads of an advertiser across Gmail, YouTube feed and Shorts.

Meanwhile, another feature is designed to increase the views of an advertiserâs video ads by ensuring the right placement of these ads.

We believe the latest move is likely to aid Google in attracting several advertisers to its platform, which will likely bolster its advertisement business.

Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus

Advertisement Business in Focus

Apart from the new AI-powered features, Google recently developed a new tool, the Ads Transparency Center, designed to enable users to know about the advertisements (ads) they see on Search, YouTube and Display.

It will act like a searchable hub for all ads served by verified advertisers. Moreover, it will show the ads served in the last 30 days from the companyâs list of verified advertisers.

This tool bodes well for Googleâs growing efforts toward making its advertisement business, which is the cash cow of Alphabet, more transparent.

The company also added new features to strengthen its Discovery ads. The features include product feeds and various layouts, product-level reporting, data-driven attributions, maximum conversions and conversion lift experiments.

Coming to YouTube ads, the company recently unveiled the YouTube Cost-Per-Hour Masthead, which complements the existing Cost-Per-Impression Masthead, to provide advertisers full share-of-voice during the hours.

In addition, the company is testing new designs to improve the organization of a product ad to help large and small businesses reach their goals. The design updates include a new navigation menu, a reorganized interface and a refreshed look and feel.

We believe the abovementioned efforts are expected to contribute generously to the performance of Googleâs advertisement business, which has been suffering from a slowdown in digital advertising for the past few quarters.

In first-quarter 2023, total Google advertising revenues fell 0.2% year over year to $54.5 billion and accounted for 78.2% of the total revenues.

Moreover, growing prospects for the advertising business will likely drive growth in Google Services revenues, which will benefit Alphabetâs overall performance and likely instill investorsâ optimism in the stock.

For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the companyâs total revenues is pegged at $248.3 billion, indicating growth of 6.2% from 2022.

Coming to price performance, GOOGL has gained 40% in the past year compared with the industryâs growth of 39.8%.

Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider

Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By Trevor Hunnicutt

WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - The Biden administration says it has picked the chairman of Google parent Alphabet Inc , John Hennessy, and four other technology industry experts to help with research and development of next-generation computer chips.

Hennessy and the other selected individuals are set to be announced by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, according to a statement seen by Reuters. They will be responsible for picking a board of trustees to run the National Semiconductor Technology Center.

That public-private partnership was authorized to lead research on next-generation chips as part of last year's bipartisan $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research law, which also subsidizes new chip plants. The nonprofit board is expected make politically sensitive decisions, including where in the United States to locate the center's research facilities.

President Joe Biden wants to expand the domestic chipmaking industry to create high-paying jobs, reduce dependence on the major producers in China and Taiwan and to give the United States an edge in the advanced technologies that will power the military technologies of the future.

Economists attribute higher consumer inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic to, among other factors, an insufficient supply of chips, which sparked shortages in cars, washing machines and video game consoles.

""We want the NSTC to be an engine of innovation, supporting and extending U.S. leadership in semiconductor research, design, engineering, and advanced manufacturing for decades to come,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. ""This selection committee is the next step to helping us stand up the NSTC and ensure it succeeds for generations.""

Hennessy, the Alphabet chairman, is also an electrical engineering and computer science professor at Stanford University.

The selection committee also includes Deloitte Consulting principal Janet Foutty, RAND Corp chief executive Jason Matheny, Anzu Partners venture capitalist and former Qualcomm executive Don Rosenberg and education nonprofit president Brenda Wilkerson.

And from Capitol Hill, additional heat on the sector could come later this week when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) unveils new details of his own plans for what he wants lawmakers to do in the months ahead.

A White House stance on AI that began with âeducate usâ

Back in May, the Biden administration brought the CEOs of Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and others to the White House for what it described as a conversation about AI while also underlining its ""expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.""

President Biden swung by that meeting and, in a short video released by the White House, warned of the ""enormous danger"" that the technology could pose. But he was solicitous overall and even went so far as to say he wanted the assembled CEOs to ""educate us"" about the technology.

To date, actions from the White House on the issue have largely been limited to things like investments in AI research and R&D efforts. But the tenor this week appears different with the promises of stronger actions to come.

The president also plans to solicit ideas on what to do next from a host of big techâs loudest critics. Tristan Harris, a longtime social media critic, is one of the leaders expected to sit down with the president. Harris, who was previously a design ethicist at Google, now studies how tech companies, he has said, ""wield dangerous power over our ability to make sense of the world."" Additionally, he was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary ""The Social Dilemma"" and serves as the co-founder and executive director of the Center for Humane Technology.

Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer is also set to attend the meeting. He's been notable for pushing Washington to take a tougher stance toward AI. (Steyer has previously led a far-reaching campaign encouraging advertisers to boycott Facebook owner Meta.)

Others at the table: Fei-Fei Li of Stanfordâs Human-Centered AI Institute is set to discuss the possible benefits of AI in sectors like medicine, while Khan Academy founder Sal Khan will likely discuss how AI could change education. Li, previously Google Cloudâs chief scientist of AI and machine learning, has also been vocal about the necessity of improving diversity in AI. Additionally, Stanfordâs Rob Reich, who has been calling for an established code of conduct among AI developers, is expected to attend the meeting, as is UC Berkeleyâs Jennifer Doudna, an expert in gene editing and its ethical parallels to AI.

The Algorithmic Justice Leagueâs Joy Buolamwin, an expert in algorithmic bias and its real-life effects, and Oren Etzioni, founding CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, are also expected to meet with President Biden.

During this trip, Biden has also crossed paths with other key AI players, notably Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, who has been vocal about AI and its possibilities. The executive and his wife hosted a fundraiser for the presidentâs re-election campaign on Monday afternoon.

""Shannon and Kev, thank you very, very much,"" Biden said at the event at the coupleâs home in Los Gatos, Calif., on Monday night before launching into his stump speech. The fundraiser was co-hosted by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in 2016 in a $26.2 billion deal.

A range of ideas from across Washington

Of course, it remains to be seen what specific actions the White House will undertake â and whether they have an impact on the fast-expanding sector. But there is movement and, apparently, urgency.

Last year, the Biden administration convened a National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee under the direction of the Commerce Department to provide recommendations on the issue. A May report from the group presented 24 ideas for action from Washington. Examples include spearheading national standards around AI risk management, retraining displaced workers, and diplomatic efforts against possible malicious AI from places like China.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a recent interview her goal was to be thoughtful about ""the most complicated tech policy discussion, possibly, that we've ever had,"" adding that many of the threats of AI may not even be understood today.

Elsewhere in Washington, a parallel process is underway on Capitol Hill, led by Sen. Schumer. The Senate Majority Leader will deliver a speech Wednesday to unveil a plan that he hopes will become the framework for a comprehensive and bipartisan approach to the issue.

Schumer also recently announced three Senator-only briefings over the coming months to educate lawmakers on the issues around artificial intelligence. After the first briefing, Schumer described the mood on Capitol Hill as ""a mix of urgency and humility; urgency because AI is developing so damn fast, and humility because AI is stupendously complex.""

Schumer himself has signaled much of his focus will be on the national security implications of the technology and he is rolling out his plan at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

995,2023-04-25T13:40:26+00:00,"The Trillion Dollar ClubâPlus is up 53% this year, but investors could see a painful, costly fall","The Trillion Dollar Club is getting so ritzy, its membership fees climbing to such exorbitant heights, that youâre better off shunning its glamorous sheen and playing your money games on cheaper courses.

Shares of companies in this golden group of five U.S. tech megastocks worth over $1 trillion, as well as two recently deposed members on the verge of regaining their valet parking passes, keep getting pricier and pricier versus the rest of the market. In the process, these stocks have come to account for a bigger and biggerâand now dangerously oversizeâshare of the S&P 500. In the broader marketâs latest surge, from mid-May to mid-June, the club members again grew far faster than the benchmark indexâwhich means that countless investors have more of their wealth than ever tied up in these stocks.

The clubâs five official, 13-figure-market-cap roster famously comprises Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and new entrantNvidia. For this analysis, Iâll add two former members that follow the clubâs dynamics so closely they could still be wearing the embossed blazers: Tesla and Meta Platforms, formerly Facebook. Weâll nickname the expanded cast the Trillion Dollar Clubâplus.

Investing history shows time and again that companies whose shares are pricey relative to the market eventually sink back to earth. So youâd think that folks and funds would be cycling out of these mostly mature tech superstars, which now offer half the earnings for every dollar invested versus the hundreds of other big-caps outside the manicured hedges. But the Club-Plus keeps catching booster rocket after booster rocket in an ascent driven more by momentum and hopes for the future of A.I. than what will really matterâits membersâ ability to hit the increasingly lofty earnings targets implied by their stock prices.

The seven stocks are a varied bunch, and some, such as Nvidia, Amazon, and Tesla, look much more extravagantly valued than an Apple or Google. Put simply, if you own an index fund or ETF that tracks the S&P 500, the Trillion Dollar ClubâPlusâs practically synchronized takeoff means that a bigger and bigger share of your money has been going into a few huge, extremely expensive stocks. If youâre considering any cap-weighted vehicle that holds a sampling of S&P big names, youâll likely face the same problem.

And that problem could become a thorny one. The share prices of companies that depend heavily on achieving big profit growth far into the future are extremely vulnerable to a rapid rise in interest rates, which is exactly the phenomenon currently darkening Americaâs economic outlook. Hence, the Trillion Dollar ClubâPlus is at risk of a reversal of its fortunes just as swift and potent as the groupâs meteoric riseâand such a turnabout could mostly erase the S&P 500âs big gains for 2023.

The Trillion Dollar ClubâPlus led the latest big rally

In the month that ended June 15, our club of seven once again far outraced the overall S&P, and in the process, lifted its weight in the index. On May 15, the club sported a combined market cap of $9.45 trillion. Over the following 30 days, it achieved a combined moonshot. Google posted the lowest gain at 6.5%, while Apple grew 8.1%, Microsoft 12%, Amazon 13.5%, and Meta 19.2%. Nvidia and Tesla reigned, advancing 50% and 55%, respectively. All told, the trillion seven added a staggering $1.58 trillion to their all-in valuation over those four weeks, or nearly 17%, lifting the total to just over $11 trillion.

Since the clubâs stock prices grew almost two and a half times as fast as the S&Pâs overall 7% increase in that 30-day span, their share of the indexâs across-the-board value waxed from 26% to 28%.

The investing trend that has dominated 2023

That two-point gain over just four weeks contributed to an already sizable increase in the clubâs power over the S&P 500. At the start of 2023, the seven tech titans sported a total market cap of $7.22 trillion, accounting for 21% of the index. Since then, every club mate has taken off at speeds that dwarfed the nonmembershipâs pace. Amazon registered the smallest gain at 23%, while Alphabet jumped 26%, Apple 29%, Microsoft 41%, Tesla 48%, Meta 89%, and Nvidia 118%. By reaching a combined worth of over $11 trillion by mid-June, the Trillion Dollar ClubâPlus has added $3.81 trillion in market cap in five and a half months. Think of the club as a single stock that gained 53% in that interlude. The performance of our âTrillion Dollar ClubâPlus Inc.â has accounted for 75% of the big-capsâ total increase of $5.1 trillion, or 11.5 percentage points of the indexâs 15.3% rise year to date.

So far this year, the clubâs moonshot has swelled its standing in the S&P by a staggering seven points, from 21% to 28%. And thatâs the problem.

The clubâs takeoff made it much, much more expensive

The clubâs extraordinary run so far this year stretched the distance between this gilded enclave and the more or less modestly valued neighborhoods occupied by the rest of the S&P 500. In 2022, the group earned a total of $260 billion, Apple proving the largest profit spinner at just under $100 billion. Hence the groupâs overall price-to-earnings multiple when the year began, at its then $7.22 trillion valuation, was 28.3. Even then, that was a big number, representing a more than 25% premium to the overall S&P.

Weâve seen only one additional quarter of earnings since the start of 2023, so it isnât surprising that the clubâs total profits for the past four reporting periods are little changed. In fact, their trailing 12-month earnings are down slightly at $256 billion. The clubâs market cap explosion of 53% this year hiked its multiple from 28.3 to a towering 43. Thatâs the sort of premium awarded to shooting stars at the beginning of their biggest growth phases. The only member of the club offering a sub-30 P/E is Alphabet at 28. Apple, Microsoft and Meta are in the 30s, and Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon hover at 75, 306, and 222, respectively. At present, the seven are selling at 82% over the S&P 500âs P/E of 23.5, and more than double the 20 multiple for the indexâs nonmembers.

What happens to the S&P if these high-fliers fall back to earth?

As the club has become a bigger and bigger part of the index, its gains have supercharged the S&Pâs advance. But the lopsided mechanics also work in the other direction. If investors suddenly change their minds, and deem these seven players highly overvalued, the decline in their shares will magnify the adjustment in the overall S&P 500âmuch more now that they account for a bloated 28% of the indexâs market cap. Letâs say investors decide to reprice the group at the still formidable P/E of 28.3 that they carried at the close of 2022. If that happens, over $3.8 trillion would disappear from the indexâs total market cap of $39.2 trillion, causing a fall of 9.5%. That hit would scuttle nearly two-thirds of the indexâs 15% gain so far in 2023.

In other words, the club has grown so big in the S&P that a move back to what investors thought its members were worth at the end of last yearâalready a high valuationâwould kill all but a few points of the big-cap indexâs impressive gains for this year. As a group, the Trillion DollarâPlus Club is looking fabulously overpriced. Theyâve been the gorilla thatâs drivenâyou might say bulliedâthe S&P back into bull market territory. A reset to anything resembling the clubâs fair value means the rally mainly carried on a mere seven shoulders will prove short-lived indeed.

996,2023-04-25T13:01:01+00:00,USA Today publisher follows DOJ in alleging Google runs online ad monopoly,"Gannett (GCI), the United States' largest newspaper publisher by circulation, has joined a handful of domestic and overseas regulators in claiming that Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) online ad tech empire is an illegal monopoly.

In a civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal district court on Tuesday, the publisher alleges that the Alphabet-owned tech giant is wielding its dominance in the ad tech market to force Gannett and other publishers to sell ad space to Google at artificially low market rates.

Gannett owns roughly 500 digital news brands, 200 local news publications and the nationally-circulated USA Today.

The practice, the suit claims, is responsible for a 70% decline in news publication's advertising revenue since 2009 despite a nine-fold increase increase in the online digital advertising market to $200 billion.

The lawsuit is somewhat unique in that it raises a company's challenge to Googleâs stronghold in the ad tech market, which so far has predominantly been attacked in suits by state and federal regulators, and in investigations by regulators overseas. The headquarters of USA Today owned by Gannett Co. is seen June 17, 2022 in McLean, Virginia. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)

In April, a journalist and former tech editor for UK news publisher The Guardian filed an antitrust complaint against Google. On behalf of UK publishers, the lawsuit alleges that Google's ad tech practices of preferencing its own products violate UK competition law.

A consulting group, Sterling International, alleged in a purported class action case filed in 2020 that Google was illegally operating its ad server business, though no activity has been filed in the case since February 2021.

On June 14, the European Commission (EC), the EU's antitrust watchdog, said in a preliminary report summarizing its investigation into Google's advertising businesses that it wants Google to divest parts of that business to cure anti-competitive concerns.

In January, the US Justice Department (DOJ) and eight US states brought an action saying Google unlawfully leveraged its monopoly in the ad tech market to block competitors from entering.

Nine additional states have since joined in that litigation. The DOJ says Google should be required to divest a host of entities that allow it to carry out the allegedly offending behavior.

'Demolished' competition

Gannett's claims are similar to those of regulators in that they allege Google is unfairly leveraging its control of online ad technology â tools that advertisers and publishers use to buy and sell online ad space.

Specifically, Gannett says Google's practices are giving publishers no choice but to sell to Google at prices lower than those available to Googleâs competitors.

""The result is dramatically less revenue for publishers and Googleâs ad-tech rivals, while Google enjoys exorbitant monopoly profits,"" the complaint states.

Gannet says Google has monopolized both the ad server market â which identifies space available for sale, solicits bids, and picks a winner â as well as the pool of available ad buyers, largely blocking buyers from participating in competing ad exchanges.

Google's digital ad exchange, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, controls more than 60% of the exchange market, and its ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, controls more than 90% of the ad server market.

""These claims are simply wrong. Publishers have many options to choose from when it comes to using advertising technology to monetize â in fact, Gannett uses dozens of competing ad services, including Google Ad Manager,â Dan Taylor, vice president of Google Ads said in response to the lawsuit. ""And when publishers choose to use Google tools, they keep the vast majority of revenue. We'll show the court how our advertising products benefit publishers and help them fund their content online.""

In Google's most recent quarter, its ad revenue totaled $54.5 billion. Approximately $6.7 billion of that revenue was generated by YouTube. Roughly $7.5 billion in ad revenue was generated by the companyâs Google Network segment, which includes revenue earned by its ad tech businesses.

Other lawsuits from regulators and news organizations have gone after Google's dominance in the online search and search advertising markets.

In 2020, the US Justice Department filed a civil antitrust complaint against the company, alleging its monopolies in search and search advertising unfairly blocked competition. That litigation is scheduled for a trial in September 2023.

Dozens of US news organizations and publishers have sued Google on similar grounds.

In 2021, a string of separate cases made claims that Google used its dominance in the markets to usurp ad revenue that should have flowed to the news outlets.

On Tuesday, Gannett CEO and chairman Mike Reed published an opinion piece in USA Today saying, ""Our lawsuit seeks to restore fair competition in a digital advertising marketplace that Google has demolished... Today, 86% of Americans read the news online. As a result, news publishers depend on digital ad revenue to provide timely, cutting-edge reporting and content that communities across the country depend on.""

997,2023-04-25T12:52:00+00:00,Should Investors Buy Shares Post-Split?,"Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors.

Of course, it's critical to remember that a split does not directly impact a company's financial position or performance.

Several companies â Tesla TSLA, Alphabet GOOGL, and Palo Alto Networks PANW â have all split their shares since the beginning of last year.

It raises a valid question: is buying post-split a good strategy? Letâs take a closer look at the performance of each post-split.

Tesla

In June of 2022, the mega-popular EV manufacturer announced a three-for-one stock split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th, 2022.

Since the split, Tesla shares are down roughly 9%, underperforming the S&P 500 handily. Still, itâs no secret that theyâve rebounded in a big way in 2023, up nearly 120%. Zacks Investment Research

Alphabet

The tech titan Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 split in early 2022. Shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 18th, 2022.

Alphabet shares have delivered a strong performance post-split so far, up roughly 13% and modestly lagging behind the S&P 500. Zacks Investment Research

The company is forecasted to grow at a solid pace, with estimates calling for 18% earnings growth on 6% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And looking ahead to FY24, earnings and revenue are forecasted to climb an additional 15% and 10%, respectively.

Palo Alto Networks

PANWâs three-for-one stock split in mid-September didnât get much attention. The companyâs shares started trading split-adjusted on September 14th, 2022.

PANW shares have been the best performers out of the bunch post-split, up more than 30% and crushing the S&P 500âs 13.4% return in the same period. Zacks Investment Research

The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, helping land it into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

Stock splits are always an exciting announcement for investors, as companies aim to boost liquidity within shares and knock down barriers to entry.

Still, buying post-split doesnât always result in considerable near-term gains, as we can see from Teslaâs TSLA and Alphabetâs GOOGL post-split performances. Conversely, Palo Alto Networks PANW shares have found plenty of buyers post-split.

998,2023-04-25T12:14:49+00:00,10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom,"In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the top 5 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom.

The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.

This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.

AI and the US Stock Market

In May, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.

This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. According to CNBC, the S&P 500 has ""basically been the S&P 7,"" a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.

""You Are At The Starting Line Of AI""

This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at ""the starting line of AI"" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.

Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, we have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. We included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but we also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today. 10 Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom

Ariel Investments mentioned Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:

âAdditionally, global leader in enterprise software,Â Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCLâs ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the companyâs cloud platform as a competitive offering.â

9. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.

There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a tech stock that can benefit immensely during the AI boom.

8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.

Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.

Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as ""the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI.""

Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.

This is what Horizon Kinetics LLC said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:

âIt is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, likeÂ Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage.

Hereâs what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. Itâs outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidiaâ¦â (Click here to read the full text)

7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.

John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.

An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.

A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.

Polen Capital mentioned Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:

âOne area we are watching regarding Alphabet andÂ Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a companyâs profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.

As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.â

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), is a smart stock pick to play the AI boom.
