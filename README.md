# Big Data Architecture for Real-Time Stock Price Forecasting Using Technical Indicators and Sentiment Analysis
This project aims to create a Big Data architecture for real-time stock price forecasting by combining advanced technical indicators and sentiment analysis based on social media and financial news

## Architecture of this project

We have set up microservices using Docker container

- Collect data from Yahoo Finance, Google News, and EOD Historical Data
- Intercept data with Apache KAFKA
- Store data in Hadoop HDFS
- Analyse data with Spark
- Sentiment Analysis with Spark-NLP
- Train a LSTM model
- Convert the model into ONNX format
- Make a dashboard with KIBANA

## Tools: 
  Docker, Zeppelin, Spark, spark-NLP, ElasticSearch, Kibana, Hadoop HDFS, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, ONNX
